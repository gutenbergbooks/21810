<p class="noindent" style="margin-bottom:2em;">A new series of books, each complete in itself, relating
the remarkable experiences of two boys and a man,
who are cast upon an island in the South Seas with
absolutely nothing but the clothing they wore. By the
exercise of their ingenuity they succeed in fashioning
clothing, tools and weapons and not only do they train
nature's forces to work for them but they subdue and
finally civilize neighboring savage tribes. The books
contain two thousand items of interest that every boy
ought to know.</p>

<h2>TREASURES OF THE ISLANDS</h2>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE PECULIAR SIGNALS</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>"Do</span> you remember, Harry, after discovering the
treasure and the skeletons of the pirates in the cave
near the Cataract, that we heard the doleful sound
of some bird while going down the hill?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that cry was something like it. Do you recall
the name of the bird, George?"</p>

<p>"It was the Alma Perdita."</p>

<p>"I remember, now; it means the 'Cry of the Lost
Soul.'"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I don't think that came from a bird.
It is more like an animal of some kind. Don't you
hear a sound that seems to be answering it?"</p>

<p>"It does seem so; I think John would know what
animal it is; but it is too late to speak to him about
it to-night, George."</p>

<p>As Harry ceased speaking, the boys heard a noise,
and George arose holding up his hand as a warning.
"I think I see something, so we ought to call John."</p>

<p>The boys quietly moved forward, and noted two
figures moving about a short distance beyond. The
boys crawled over to the place where John was sleep<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_16" id="p_16" href="#p_16">p. 16</a></span>ing,
and found that the place he occupied, as well as
that of Uraso's vacant.</p>

<p>"That must be John and Uraso over there," remarked
Harry in a whisper.</p>

<p>They were confirmed in this on approaching the
moving figures, and saw that both were armed, and
also that they were watching another moving figure
beyond.</p>

<p>"Is that a bird or an animal?" asked George.</p>

<p>"An animal," replied John, in an undertone.</p>

<p>"That was my opinion from the first," remarked
George, who turned to Harry with a sort of 'I told
you so,' expression.</p>

<p>"But it is a two-legged animal," responded John.</p>

<p>"How long have you been up?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"More than an hour," said Uraso. "Muro is now
coming back, and we shall know something more definite."</p>

<p>"Then that is Muro?" asked George, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes; he has been stalking the ones making that
noise, and was the one who called our attention to
it."</p>

<p>Muro disappeared, and the peculiar cries were repeated,
then, most startlingly, a sound, similar in
character, appeared to come from a point very close
to where they were now crouching.</p>

<p>John turned to Uraso in astonishment. The latter
did not seem at all perturbed, but after the second
cry Uraso imitated the sound, and John smiled.</p>

<p>"Muro has the exact tone now," said John.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Uraso, "and the cry I gave was an
answer, which Uraso understands."</p>

<p>In a few minutes Muro appeared, but he was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_17" id="p_17" href="#p_17">p. 17</a></span>
smiling. His face was grave, as he said: "We have
come upon the terrible Konotos. I feared that when
I heard the first cry several hours ago."</p>

<p>"Have you been near them?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Near enough to know that there are quite a number,
and what is more, they are now engaged in their
regular feast, and if they have any captives, this is
the time that they will be sacrificed," said Muro.</p>

<p>"Why do you think this is the time for that?"
asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Because it was now nearing the <i>dark of the moon</i>,
as you call it, and that time is chosen because the
Great Spirit, out of anger, is hiding the light."</p>

<p>The boys now understood that this was a rite practiced
by some of the tribes on Wonder Island, during
that season of the Moon's phase.</p>

<p>"Did you talk with them in that strange language?"
asked Harry.</p>

<p>"No; but I tried to find out the key to the language
they used."</p>

<p>"Is that their regular language?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! That is simply the special language
which they use on certain occasions," answered
Muro.</p>

<p>"The savages here, as everywhere, have a sort of
code language, or a species of wireless telegraphy,
used by them only when in the presence of enemies,"
commented John.</p>

<p>"Harry and I thought it might be the Alma Perdita,
that we heard at the cave near Cataract."</p>

<p>"No; but it shows the ingenuity of the savages,
when I explain that their most favored method is to
assume the cry of some bird or animal, and in so<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_18" id="p_18" href="#p_18">p. 18</a></span>
doing make it difficult for the enemy to distinguish
the assumed from the real."</p>

<p>"But on Wonder Island we had several methods
of talking to each other," remarked Uraso. "For
instance, we would perfectly imitate the cries of a
number of birds, and also of certain animals, and of
the wood insects. Thus, a nightingale would mean
<i>watchfulness</i>; the chirrup of a cricket would be the
signal that the enemy was not dangerous, or that
there were not many of them; the cry of the Lost
Soul bird would indicate that there was great danger,
and so on with the birds and animals that make
noises."</p>

<p>"But I have discovered another thing," remarked
Muro.</p>

<p>"And what is that?" said John.</p>

<p>"The natives here are cannibals."</p>

<p>"That merely confirms my knowledge of the matter,"
said John.</p>

<p>The boys looked at John in amazement. How did
John know there were cannibals on the island?</p>

<p>"When did you learn that?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Yesterday," was his reply.</p>

<p>"What did you find that makes you believe that?"</p>

<p>"I discovered a bone which was once part of a
human body."</p>

<p>"But how would that be any indication that the
people here are cannibals?"</p>

<p>"When you see a bone that has on it the unmistakable
markings of human teeth, it is pretty safe to
infer that the animal which scratched the bone was
a cannibal."</p>

<p>From the report of Muro it was evident that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_19" id="p_19" href="#p_19">p. 19</a></span>
was a large number of people on the island, and, if
Muro's observations were correct, they now had some
captives, or, at least, were preparing to celebrate a
feast in which human beings were to be the victims.</p>

<p>"That satisfies me of one thing," said Harry.</p>

<p>"And what is that?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Why, that there must be other tribes on the island,"
he answered.</p>

<p>"Why do you infer that?"</p>

<p>"Well, where would they get the victims?"</p>

<p>"From their own people," answered John.</p>

<p>"What! eat their own people?" asked George.</p>

<p>"That is not at all strange. Many people are
known to sacrifice their own, and among the most
degraded, they are known to kill and eat their own."</p>

<p>"That is the first time I have heard of such a
thing."</p>

<p>"Don't you remember that the Bible tells about
Abraham about to offer up his own son as a sacrifice?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but not to eat him."</p>

<p>"Of course not; but it is not an uncommon thing
for tribes in Africa to sell their own children for this
purpose. One of the greatest sacrificial rites of the
ancient Mexicans, was to offer up the most handsome
youth each year, as a propitiation to the gods."</p>

<p>"So they do not always depend on their enemies to
furnish the feast?"</p>

<p>"By no means. Many of the tribes have a superstition
that if they eat a brave enemy it will impart to
them his spirit of valor, and the fact that they are
to have sacrifices here does not mean that there are
various tribes on the island; but that is something we<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_20" id="p_20" href="#p_20">p. 20</a></span>
shall have to investigate. It is my opinion that we
shall find other tribes, but that, I am inclined to
think, depends upon the size of the island."</p>

<hr class='sorta' />

<p>The preceding volume, "Adventures Among
Strange Islands," states the conditions under which
the two boys, Harry and George, found themselves
on a strange island, in the southern Pacific. Accompanying
them were John L. Varney, and about
sixty natives from Wonder Island, together with the
two Chiefs Uraso and Muro.</p>

<p>Nearly three years previously the boys, George
Mayfield and Harry Crandall, who were members
of the crew of a school-ship, the <i>Investigator</i> sailed
from New York, and while on board, met a professor,
who, when the ship was blown up at sea, became their
companion in the life boat in which they sought
refuge. Together they finally were stranded upon
an unknown island, less than a hundred miles from
the island which was the scene of the adventures with
which we are now concerned.</p>

<p>On this island they discovered five or six savage
tribes, from some of which they rescued seven of
their former boy companions. Here also they met
Mr. Varney, who had escaped from the savages.
The Professor succeeded in reconciling all the warring
tribes, and the natives were now engaged in
agriculture, and in various other pursuits, and the
boys had the great pleasure and satisfaction of being
able to build their own vessel and return home. The
trip to the Wonderful island, with which this volume
deals, was for a double purpose, as will presently be
shown.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_21" id="p_21" href="#p_21">p. 21</a></span></p>

<p>John, as Mr. Varney was familiarly known to them,
was not only a well educated man, but a great adventurer,
and had traveled all over the world in pursuit
of scientific knowledge. He was particularly interested
in the history of the men who first went to
the western world, and scattered civilization to the
benighted countries.</p>

<p>Like many men of his character, he did not consider
the question of money. He tried to acquire
knowledge and information for the love of the quest,
and in order to be of service to his fellow man, so
it was purely by accident that he became a member
of a crew that sailed for the southern seas at the
same time that the boys left New York on their trip.</p>

<p>While his companions undertook the mission solely
for the sake of the money which might be acquired,
John engaged thinking it might offer the means of
laying bare many of the early legends and vague historical
accounts with which that region of the South
Seas abounds, and he knew that if any records were
in existence, they could be preserved only in such
secure places as caverns, which the Spanish buccaneers
invariably selected as the safest places to conceal
their treasures.</p>

<p>While the boys, together with the Professor and
John, had found a vast amount of treasure, as stated
in the first six volumes containing the history of
Wonder Island, they found not a single scrap of historical
value, excepting a few traces, which have been
referred to, and certain inscriptions which all pointed
to the same depositary, somewhere in the South Seas.</p>

<p>The last inscription was found by John, shortly
before they left Wonder Island, and which, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_22" id="p_22" href="#p_22">p. 22</a></span>
its full meaning was wrapt in mystery, pointed, as
did the others, to another island than the one on
which it was found. What made the matter still
more interesting, was the knowledge that some one,
by the name of Walters, either had prepared the inscription,
or had some knowledge of what it meant.</p>

<p>This man was not known to any of the party, and
what made it the more remarkable was the information,
lately obtained, that while Walters, apparently,
knew one of the companions who accompanied John
on his wrecked vessel, that man did not know Walters,
at least not by that name.</p>

<p>These circumstances, together with numerous
other incidents, which the boys could not understand,
or unravel, made such an impression on them, that
they were determined to devote their energies to ferret
out the inexplicable things, and the earnestness
of John was a great incentive in the undertaking.</p>

<p>Up to this time the boys did not know the real motive
in the mind of John. To them this quest on his
part was to find out where the Treasure islands were
for the material value that might be obtained.</p>

<p>His long silence about the real design had been
purposely concealed by him, as he felt that merely to
delve into the hidden recesses of the islands would
not be understood by them in its real sense, because
as boys they could not appreciate that real knowledge
always must be disassociated from the idea of
material or commercial gain.</p>

<p>It was with a great deal of anxiety that the boys
waited for the morning sun. They had but a comparatively
small force to deal with the situation.
True, they were equipped with fire-arms, and they<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_23" id="p_23" href="#p_23">p. 23</a></span>
knew that the <i>Pioneer</i>, their vessel, would return
within a week, still, within that time the large number
of natives might be able to surround them, and
unless they could get some word to the ship, and by
that means enable their friends to send reinforcements,
they would be starved out.</p>

<p>As soon as the camp was astir there was a consultation.
John had fully matured a plan in his mind,
but it was always a pleasure, as it had been with the
Professor, to present any complications to the boys,
so that they could take a hand in the developments
which might follow.</p>

<p>"Harry and I have been considering the matter,"
said George. "We think it would be well to leave
this place, and go back to the landing and wait for the
<i>Pioneer</i>. We will then be ready, with reinforcements
to meet them with more than an even chance."</p>

<p>"But," remarked John; "are you willing to go
back, and permit the devils here to destroy the captives
they may have, or, to prevent them from sacrificing
their own people?"</p>

<p>The boys had not thought of this. "I know the
feast days, during which these events will take place,
will occur within the next four days," added Muro.</p>

<p>"If that is so," said Harry, "I am willing to do
my share in keeping them from it. What do you
suggest?"</p>

<p>"We must try to get into communication with
them, and if we fail then I am in favor of taking some
stringent measures to divert them from their purpose,"
answered John.</p>

<p>"Then you may be assured we are with you to the
end," said George.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_24" id="p_24" href="#p_24">p. 24</a></span></p>

<p>"After talking with Uraso and Muro, we have
agreed on a plan that may be successful, and it will
at any rate, for the time, prevent them from carrying
out their festival scheme." As John said this Muro
appeared, and stated that he had discovered the arrival
of at least a hundred natives on the hill beyond
the second ravine, and that he saw smoke on the third
hill beyond that, and was of the opinion that the village
must not be far away.</p>

<p>This intelligence added interest to the situation.
As nearly as could be estimated they were at least
fifteen miles from the landing place selected when the
<i>Pioneer</i> sailed.</p>

<p>"Unless I am very much mistaken the ridge on
which we now are is the backbone of the island, and I
also believe that it is narrow and we should be able
to find the sea much nearer by going east from this
place," remarked John.</p>

<p>"But if we do that it will be necessary for some one
to go to the place selected for the landing of the
<i>Pioneer</i>, and tell them of our plans, and what we
have learned," said Harry.</p>

<p>"That is what I have in mind. But before doing
that we must investigate this portion of the island
more carefully. My plan is as follows: Along this
ridge, further to the east, is a sheltered spot, or a
place where the rocks form a sort of cove, and which
can be easily defended. If the natives have not
reached that quarter it will make an ideal retreat for
us, and where we can defend ourselves for an indefinite
time."</p>

<p>"But why should we take up time to find a place<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_25" id="p_25" href="#p_25">p. 25</a></span>
like that if you intend to take steps toward meeting
the natives?"</p>

<p>"It will be used to fall back upon."</p>

<p>"Oh, then you intend to take measures against
them at once?"</p>

<p>"Not for the first day, at least. As soon as we are
established there we will investigate the region to the
east, and if we find the shore line closer on the eastern
shore, we can then send a runner with a message
to the landing place, giving them the information."</p>

<p>The boys now understood. It was evident that it
would have been bad policy to retreat in face of the
enemy, if such he should prove to be. Something
must be done to divert the natives for the time being.
This would give them time to communicate with their
vessel.</p>

<p>"There is one thing that must be remembered.
The savages know of our presence here. They are
now on the alert, and we are being watched with the
greatest vigilance. If they think there is an opportunity
for fresh victims it will stimulate them to the
greatest exertions."</p>

<p>"I agree with you in that view," said Uraso, as

<h3>THE SAVAGES ON THE HILL</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> a hurried breakfast the party marched
along the southern crest of the hill, keeping as much
out of view of the watchers on the northern side as
possible. The course adopted was one well calculated
to deceive the natives, for while the main bulk
of the party silently left the camping place, a half
dozen of their companions were left behind, and they
were particular to remain exposed at intervals, so
that the departure of the main party would not be
discovered.</p>

<p>To those left behind, John said: "Remain here until
you hear firing. In that event you will know that
we have met them, and that fact will be sufficient notice
that your duty here is at an end. Uraso has
begged the privilege of being with you, and you know
that is an assurance of your safety in any event."</p>

<p>The place suggested by John was not over two
miles distant. Muro went ahead with one of the
most reliable men of his tribe, and at intervals this
runner was sent back with the information that the
course was clear.</p>

<p>Everything pointed to the success of the scheme,
until they were within sight of the place, when the
runner came back hurriedly with the information
that Muro had seen the first of the natives, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_27" id="p_27" href="#p_27">p. 27</a></span>
felt certain that they were at the place selected for
their fort.</p>

<p>The party halted. The runner returned, and John
sent back a messenger to Uraso, advising him to come
forward at once. Within fifteen minutes the messenger
returned with the startling information that
the natives were between them and Uraso.</p>

<p>This was, indeed, surprising. Either they were
experts at stalking enemies, or they had been fortunate
enough to bring up a force in such a position as
to make Uraso's escape a most hazardous one.</p>

<p>"We must make the best of the situation," said
John. "Let us prepare to receive them, if they are
determined to attack us."</p>

<p>"But what shall we do about Uraso?" asked
Harry, in some consternation.</p>

<p>"I think Uraso knows how to take care of the
situation. He is shrewd enough to outwit them, and
if there is any danger from that quarter, he will let
us know."</p>

<p>"But how can he let us know if his messenger cannot
get through?"</p>

<p>John smiled, as he looked at George, and responded:
"You have evidently forgotten that Uraso
has the best signaling instrument in the world, the
gun."</p>

<p>"Certainly; I had forgotten that. But what shall
we do if&mdash;" His voice was cut short by a shot from
the direction of Uraso's position.</p>

<p>"There it is," said Harry. "Two more shots!"</p>

<p>The scout from the rear now came in on a leap.
"They are coming this way," he hurriedly informed
John.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_28" id="p_28" href="#p_28">p. 28</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are coming?" asked John.</p>

<p>"The natives."</p>

<p>"Lie down!" he commanded. "No one must fire
until I give the command. Oto, go to Muro at once,
and tell him to come back immediately."</p>

<p>In the distance to the west could be seen little
squads of natives coming directly toward them. In
the different groups were fully fifteen men, all armed
with spears and bows and arrows.</p>

<p>"Uraso is driving them this way; I am sure of
that," remarked John, as he watched their maneuvers.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" asked George.</p>

<p>"They are simply retreating, thinking, in all probability
that they have met our entire band. They do
not know we are here."</p>

<p>"Brave Uraso! I hope he will not get into danger,"
said George. "There they are now; see them
on the ridge to&mdash;"</p>

<p>A shot from the direction of Muro now awoke them
to action. The moment that sound reached the oncoming
savages, they halted, and huddled together,
evidently in confusion at the meaning of the new
alarm.</p>

<p>"Ah! they are puzzled!" Then, after a pause,
he continued: "I hope Muro is not in trouble! I
do not understand why his messenger has not returned."</p>

<p>Within ten minutes of the report of the gun which
has just been referred to, the messenger sent by
John, came in and stated that it was impossible for
him to reach Muro, as the hill directly to the east
was alive with warriors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_29" id="p_29" href="#p_29">p. 29</a></span></p>

<p>It was now Muro's turn to get the sympathy of the
boys, and both of them turned to John, who still
seemed unperturbed.</p>

<p>"We will march directly to the east," he announced.
"Every man must hold his gun ready for
instant firing. Move forward quietly, as you have
been doing. We must go to the assistance of Muro.
Uraso will take care of the rear."</p>

<p>They glided along the crest, directly behind John,
and as they passed over the hill, it was evident that
the natives were out in force.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether they have captured Muro?"
asked Harry.</p>

<p>"No; he is all right. You may depend on it that
he will not be taken without a warning shot is given."</p>

<p>"But we heard a shot."</p>

<p>"True; but that was the messenger."</p>

<p>From the manner in which the natives in their
front were scurrying to and fro, it was apparent to
John's practiced mind, they had no idea of the approach
of John and his party. It was plain that they
knew of Muro, or, at least of some one beyond the second
hill, where John inferred Muro must have gone,
because all their energies appeared to be directed toward
that point.</p>

<p>"I am afraid they are after Muro, but I am sure
if he finds himself in danger he will fire a shot to
warn us. In such a situation we must attract their
attention. I will detail the first squad to accompany
me. All those remaining will conceal themselves,
and under no circumstances show yourselves, or let
your presence be known, unless you are attacked.
We will go to the point beyond the two large trees,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_30" id="p_30" href="#p_30">p. 30</a></span>
and make the demonstration there, thus drawing
them away from Muro."</p>

<p>John with the six men designated hurried over the
intervening ground, just as two shots, undoubtedly
from Muro, broke the quiet, and placed the watchers
on the alert. In less than ten minutes the boys heard
a volley to the right, and almost instantly the opposite
slope was alive with natives running to and fro
in all directions, and the most peculiar cries were
heard, while in the distance there was a singular
rhythmic sound as though drums were being beaten,
in regular time.</p>

<p>It sounded very weird and fascinating. The
drums, if such they were, had different keys, and
their companions did not appear to be able to give
any information about them.</p>

<p>While thus waiting for John to appear, the watchers
were surprised to see the force which was between
Uraso and themselves, rushing alongside the hill, and
directly toward their place of concealment. Here
was a problem, not contemplated by John, and the
boys consulted the men with them.</p>

<p>Harry said: "I will do what has always been our
custom, that is first show ourselves, and indicate
that we do not wish to be enemies, and try to gain
their confidence."</p>

<p>"I think some of the men should try to talk to
them. It is possible that they may be acquainted
with their language. You remember the one we captured
could understand what Muro said," suggested
George.</p>

<p>It should be stated that after they landed on the
island, four days previously, they had made a short<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_31" id="p_31" href="#p_31">p. 31</a></span>
excursion into the interior, where they were attacked
by a tribe, of which one of the men was captured,
after being wounded, and then taken by the Professor
on board the <i>Pioneer</i>, and carried to Wonder Island.</p>

<p>The savages came forward apparently without
knowing of the existence of our party, and when
within two hundred feet Harry, and Tarra, one of the
most intelligent of the islanders, stepped forward,
and waved their hands.</p>

<p>The natives stopped in astonishment. Tarra
spoke to them, but they were mute. Then Tarra
turned to Harry, and rubbed his nose, and made a
sign of friendship. After some hesitation the leader,
who was, from all appearance a chief, answered, that
they demanded the delivery to them of the wounded
man. After this was interpreted Harry assured him
that the man would be restored safe and sound, as
soon as he was cured.</p>

<p>At this information the Chief told Tarra that he
lied, and that he had been taken for the purpose of
being sacrificed. He was assured that such was not
the case, as they did not believe in sacrificing human
beings.</p>

<p>The Chief then demanded that they leave the island
at once, or they would kill all of them. Tarra
laughed at this announcement, and his demeanor was
such as to astound the natives. "You do not know
what you say," said Tarra. "The white people who
are with us have fire guns, which kill when they
speak," and he held up one of them, and the boys
were amused to see how quickly they began to waver
and look about for shelter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_32" id="p_32" href="#p_32">p. 32</a></span></p>

<p>"We have not come here to injure you," said
Tarra. "We want to be friends."</p>

<p>This appeal did not affect the Chief, but seeing his
men disappear he silently withdrew to the north.
They had scarcely gone before Uraso and his men
appeared in the tall grass beyond, and were most
heartily welcomed by the boys.</p>

<p>Uraso laughed as he related their experience. He
said that the band came up, after John and the party
left, and in order to make as big a showing as possible
he and his companions hid in the grass, being
separated from each other twenty feet or more, thus
making a line over a hundred feet in length.</p>

<p>The savages did not know that the entire line was
occupied only by seven men. To all appearances the
waving of the grass at the different points along the
line, indicated to them the presence of a large force.
As a result they started for the east, instead of going
to the south, as Uraso had calculated they would do,
and which indeed they would have done had they not
heard the peculiar savage-made signals of the party
which was hunting Muro.</p>

<p>The movement of the band in that direction drove
them directly toward the watchers who had been left
behind by John, and for them to meet a second party,
immediately after they left Uraso, must have been
a most astonishing thing to them.</p>

<p>But the savages were still more confounded, when,
after leaving the boys, they learned from the signals
that a third party (the one with John), was still further
to the east.</p>

<p>The first evidence the boys had, that the last party
had reached the main band of savages, was the re<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_33" id="p_33" href="#p_33">p. 33</a></span>currence
of the same peculiar sounds that were heard
during the night.</p>

<p>"They are telling them that we are all over the
island. They are worried about the situation," said
Uraso. "John purposely took the men forward in
order to create the impression that our people might
be found everywhere."</p>

<p>"Did you hear the shots that Muro fired?" asked
George.</p>

<p>"Yes; they were on all sides of him, undoubtedly,
but I am satisfied he is all right now."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"For the reason that the natives are retreating,
and dare not attack him. The last signs were those
indicating danger. They were entirely different
from those sent out last night."</p>

<p>The peculiar drum beats ceased. Only occasionally
could the plaintive signal cry be heard, and after
waiting for more than half hour, the boys were delighted
to see John and Muro appear on the distant
hill, accompanied by the men who were detailed with
him.</p>

<p>Muro's story was an interesting one. He went directly
east for a distance of nearly two miles, passing
between two different parties, who were, of
course, unaware of his presence. He sent the messenger
back when he met the first natives, and when
this messenger was on his way back he found the
savages before him, and they made a rush which
he stopped by the shot which John and the boys
heard.</p>

<p>After he had passed the second lot of natives he
ascended the second hill, and beheld, far in the east,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_34" id="p_34" href="#p_34">p. 34</a></span>
the open sea. This, he knew, was a matter of prime
importance to them, as he felt assured it could not be
more than five miles distant.</p>

<p>While investigating the shore line, in order to select
some particular marking point, by means of
which they might be able to direct the <i>Pioneer</i>, he
was surrounded by the natives. Not that they knew
he was at that particular place, but, as he was now
near the rocky headland which he was seeking, it
occurred to him that they might be going on the same
mission, and before he could extricate himself a small
band intercepted him.</p>

<p>He told them that they were friends and not enemies,
and tried to win them over by promises of
reward. For some reason or other they declined to
treat with him, and he then had to resort to the rifle
to impress them with the invisible power which he
possessed.</p>

<p>This was done by the two shots which the boys
heard. They were of course awed by the explosion,
and by the effect of the shots, and since it did not
seem to bring about the desired results, he coolly
marched away, and told them that they dared not
follow him.</p>

<p>His bravery undoubtedly proved his salvation, for
they were too much astounded to move at his audacity.
He did not go far, because he knew that his
safety lay in keeping himself concealed, since he felt
assured that it would not be long before John would
resort to some device to attract their attention.</p>

<p>His calculations were justified, for within a quarter
of an hour he heard the volley which John ordered,
and in an in creditable short space of time the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_35" id="p_35" href="#p_35">p. 35</a></span>
woods were cleared of the watching natives, who, undoubtedly,
were on the alert to capture him.</p>

<p>"The boys went with me to the foot of the hill,"
said John. "I knew Muro would fire three shots if
he were in danger. When we were half way up the
hill, we saw the natives stealthily moving around
the hill, as though trying to encircle the position
among the rocks. It was enough to indicate to me
that Muro was the one they were stalking.</p>

<p>"We did not shoot at the natives, but intended it
merely as a warning. It was sufficient, for they made
for cover at once, and within ten minutes we heard
Muro's signal, and found him safe."</p>

<p>"But isn't that fine about the sea?" said Harry
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Yes; and that means we must now send a message
to the landing place. Muro, did you see enough
of the shore line to enable you to describe it?" asked
John.</p>

<p>"I was not near enough to tell exactly, but I believe
it is directly east of our landing place, but,
of course, on the opposite side of the island," was
his response.</p>

<p>"That will be near enough. Our work is on this
side of the island. As soon as we have quieted down
a little you will hear some news," said John as he
glanced at the boys significantly.</p>

<p>The runner was directed to proceed to the landing
place, and to remain there during the night. He was
then to return the first thing in the morning, and
would find the party camped at the rocky height beyond.</p>

<p>Without waiting for further explanations, and de<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_36" id="p_36" href="#p_36">p. 36</a></span>tails
of experiences, they started for the place where
they might find some shelter from the numerous foes,
and at which place they might be able to formulate
a plan to get into communication with the natives.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when they gained the
rocky heights, and saw the wild nature of the surroundings.</p>

<p>"How did you know this place was here?" asked
Harry.</p>

</a>
<span class="scribedcaption">Fig. 1. <span class="u">The</span> <span class="u">Marimba</span>.</span>
</div>

<p>"I was here day before yesterday, and it was from
this place we started when we heard your first guns
in the battle you had with the natives," was John's
answer.</p>

<p>"But how does it happen that you did not see the
ocean?"</p>

<p>"Well, are you able to see the ocean anywhere
from this point?" he was asked.</p>

<p>The question was a natural one, for when Muro
came over the last hill to the south the sea was visible,
but the rocky point was to the north, and thus out of
range.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_37" id="p_37" href="#p_37">p. 37</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you hear the singular drum-like sounds this
afternoon?"</p>

<p>"They were drums," answered John, "and most
peculiar ones, too. I have not seen the ones used
by the natives here, but they have the same resonant
sounds made by certain African tribes, and also by
some South American savages."</p>

<p>"What is it like?" was Harry's next question.</p>

<p>"They are made of flat pieces of wood, very thin,
laid over open-topped gourds. The gourds are, of
course, dried, and the dryer they are, the more resonant
the sound."</p>

<p>"Why, that is something like the Xylophone."</p>

<p>"Exactly so. That instrument is of savage origin.
Instead of gourds some tribes use calabashes, which
grow to enormous size, and they are highly prized
owing to the quality of the sound they produce when
used in this way."</p>

<p>"But the ones we heard had different tones."</p>

<p>"They use wooden strips of different lengths, exactly
like the Xylophone. They are called Marimbas,
balafongs and sansas, by the various tribes."</p>

<p>While George, Harry and Uraso, were scouting to
the north they unexpectedly came around the corner
of a hill, from which they could see a beautiful
valley running to the north, and directly opposite, on
a little plateau, was a type of mountain deer, standing
like a sentinel near the precipitous edge, while below
were dozens feeding.</p>

<p>The boys dared not shoot at them, but they remembered
the place, and made up their minds that as soon
as they had made friends of the natives they would
have a hunt in this section.</p>

<h3>CAPTURE OF THE VILLAGE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most trying time for all adventurers and explorers,
is after night has set in. During the daytime
there is always plenty to take up one's attention
and energies, but as the sun goes down the world
seems to contract into a very small space, and when
enemies are near the burden of waiting is a doubly
trying one.</p>

<p>The boys had spent many such nights. Whenever
John or the Professor were about these hours were
always enjoyed, because like all healthy boys, they
were ever on the alert to ask questions which happened
to be suggested by the experiences of the day.</p>

<p>Now, it is a singular thing, that there is no selfishness
in education. True education is charitable.
Those who crave it with the most eagerness, are always
the foremost in wishing to impart it to others.
The honest learner does not resent the listening ear
of his fellow pupils.</p>

<p>Uraso and Muro, the two chiefs, who were the
first to conceive the advantages of education at the
hands of John and the Professor, were always on
the alert at the evening meetings, whenever their
duties permitted it, and hundreds of the natives of
Wonder Island craved the privilege of hearing the
conversations which took place on all sorts of topics.</p>

<p>In Unity, the capital of Wonder Island, schools had<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_39" id="p_39" href="#p_39">p. 39</a></span>
been established and were flourishing, and all the children
were pupils, so that within another generation
there would be a tremendous change for the better
among those people.</p>

<p>There was nothing more enjoyable to the boys than
to see the intense interest manifested by the common
natives, when night came on, and they expected one
of the treats which they knew would be in store for
them.</p>

<p>On these occasions George and Harry were usually
the questioners, but many times they saw that some
of the men seemed to desire additional information,
and by degrees the boys encouraged them to put the
questions, and to seek inquiries.</p>

<p>This had a very stimulating effect. John was delighted
at the spirit thus developed, and he gave it a
still broader range by refusing sometimes to answer
the questions, and thus inviting answers from the
men themselves.</p>

<p>Thus discussion developed. It taught them to begin
to think for themselves. If men know that the
ready answer is always at hand, it prevents the mind
from expanding. The evenings, therefore, were seasons
of enjoyment, alike to the men as well as to the
boys.</p>

<p>After they had reached the cove in the rocks, and
all the dispositions had been made for the night, John
warned the men that while the natives were no doubt,
in consternation, the utmost care must be observed to
prevent any surprises.</p>

<p>The moon had not yet arisen, but there was a beautiful
clear sky. The great Southern Cross hung in
the heavens like a giant lantern. On one side, and on<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_40" id="p_40" href="#p_40">p. 40</a></span>
line with each other, shone the two brightest stars in
the heavens, the first being the Dog Star Sirius, and
the next in order, Canopus, the one white, and the
other a yellowish white.</p>

<p>Then, on the other side of the Great Cross, sparkled
Antares, the brilliant red star, of the first magnitude,
while Spica, another star made up a most remarkable
combination of heavenly orbs.</p>

<p>George had always been impressed with the appearance
and the arrangement of the stars, and he
was struck by the intense interest which all savages
manifested in astronomy.</p>

<p>"Your observations are correct," said John, when
the discussion began. "Almost all of the savage
rites, their feasts and religious ceremonials, have
something to do with the appearances and the movements
of the heavenly bodies."</p>

<p>"I suppose the grouping of the stars, when they
named these groups of the planets after animals, and
the like, was done by the ancients, and really meant
something in a religious way," ventured Harry.</p>

<p>"It is difficult really to determine the origin of
what is called the Zodiac. From the evidence attainable
it was known to the Babylonians, over 2300 years
before the Christian era. They divided the heavens
into twelve parts, each cluster of stars representing
some fanciful animal or being, such as the Lion, or
the Bear, or the Dragon."</p>

<p>"Isn't it funny that the tribes here, as well as some
on Wonder Island have an idea that the dark moon is
caused by the Great Spirit trying to hide it in anger?"
asked George.</p>

<p>"It is singular when it is considered that the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_41" id="p_41" href="#p_41">p. 41</a></span>
superstition is found in many, many tribes, on different
continents, and it induces the belief that this idea
had one common origin, and that the people all
sprang from one source, or, that the different peoples
worked out the ideas independently of each other."</p>

<p>This statement caused considerable discussion, the
natives being of the opinion that the idea was worked
out by the different peoples and could not have been
spread broadcast by one set of people.</p>

<p>"Why do you think it could not have come from
one race?" asked George, as Uraso urged.</p>

<p>"Because," he answered, "how did the people in
olden times cross the big ocean? Even now, people
like my own, dare not venture on the sea, for any
distance from shore."</p>

<p>"But," said John, "the surface of the earth was
not originally like it is now. In many places over the
earth, new lands have appeared,&mdash;that is, they come
up out of the sea, and other lands have disappeared.
We have records of islands, and parts of continents,
hundreds of times larger than Wonder Island, which
have disappeared in a single day. One of those, near
Japan, sank, and engulfed over 200,000 people."</p>

<p>"You surprise me," said Muro.</p>

<p>"Furthermore, there is pretty conclusive evidence
that the continents of Europe and America, were
once joined, or that there was an immense continent,
called Atlantis between the eastern and western hemispheres."</p>

<p>"I read something on that subject some time ago,
in which the writer denied that such a thing was
possible," said Harry.</p>

which are difficult to explain, unless the two hemispheres
were once united, or, at any rate, were close
enough together to permit travel from one part to the
other."</p>

<p>"What evidence is there on that point?"</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place, the root of the languages
in Central America, and in Mexico, are the same as in
the corresponding latitude in Europe and Africa.
Then the Pyramids of Mexico are built on the same
plan, and located, astronomically, the same as those
in Egypt."</p>

<p>"But could not the ancients have crossed the seas,
and in that way given the same knowledge to both sections?"</p>

<p>"There is absolutely no evidence that the ancients
had vessels capable of traversing 2000 miles of
ocean."</p>

<p>"But the book I read said that the Western Hemisphere
merely broke away from the main body of the
land, and that is why the people here knew all that
those in Europe had learned."</p>

<p>"That is very plausible, and for the purpose of giving
you a fair understanding of the matter, I make
a sketch, showing (<a href="#illus-043">Fig. 2</a>), the Atlantean theory, in
which the western shores of Europe and Africa, and
the eastern shores of North and South America are
outlined, and between them, in dotted lines, is Atlantis,
the only part of that vast continent now being
visible being the Azore Islands, at the northern extremity."</p>

<p>"But what evidence is there that such a continent
existed? Is it only a theory?"</p>

<p>"It is supported by some evidence, much of which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_44" id="p_44" href="#p_44">p. 44</a></span>
like the account which the Egyptian priests gave to
Solon, would take too long to state; but some years
ago, while Darwin was engaged in making the deep
sea soundings in the ship <i>Challenger</i>, it was found
that the bed of the Atlantic showed a raised plateau,
where the legendary Atlantis was claimed to be."</p>

<p>"But might it not be possible that the other theory
could be correct, also,&mdash;that is, that North America
merely broke away, and in breaking away, left Atlantis
as an island?"</p>

<p>"I do not see how it can be reconciled. In the first
sketch (<a href="#illus-043">Fig. 2</a>), note the shape of the continent of
Atlantis. Now, in the next sketch (<a href="#illus-046">Fig. 3</a>), I have
brought the two continents close up to each other.
The outlines appear similar, and it would be difficult
to make them fit together, if Atlantis should be placed
there, or left in that space, after the breaking apart."</p>

<p>The discussion was closed for the night and arrangements
made for sleep and sentry duty.</p>

<p>Frequently during the night the beating of the
singular drums was heard. After the entertainment
of the evening both Muro and Uraso undertook some
scouting on their own account. The boys were awake
early, and then learned of their expeditions.</p>

<p>Three miles north of the rocky point the main village
was located. They had crept forward cautiously
until close enough to learn that there must be
fully five hundred inhabitants. But what was more
surprising still, was the evidence they obtained that
the tribes believed in the Hoodoos and the witch doctors.</p>

</div>

<p>The boys were jubilant at the information, and
John was full of smiles as he imparted the
informa<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_46" id="p_46" href="#p_46">p. 46</a></span>tion.
The difficulty was to get into communication
with the natives, as their efforts of the preceding day
did not offer much encouragement in that direction.</p>

<p>The fact that the people on the island observed peculiar
rites was evidence to John that they must be
steeped in the superstitions that are a necessary part
of the craft of the witch doctors, and to the boys,
as well as to Uraso and Muro, the opportunity for
John to match his intelligence with the crafty Krishnos,
was awaited with interest.</p>

<p>It was shown on Wonder Island, that while the
people had the most implicit confidence in their medicine
men, they were the first to cause their overthrow
when it was shown that they maintained their superiority
through deceit.</p>

<p>Before nine o'clock the drums began to beat.
They were plainly heard, as there was a slight breeze
from that direction. John selected fifteen of the
warriors, and accompanied by the boys, and Muro
and Uraso, started for the village.</p>

<p>"You are to remain here until you get word from
us. If you should hear heavy firing it will be the signal
for you to come on without delay. In such a case
approach cautiously, and rush them, so as to reach us.
We do not want to cause the loss of a single life
among them, except as a last resort to save our own.
Otherwise you are not to leave the cove. One must
be sent to the height beyond, to keep a watch for the
<i>Pioneer</i>.</p>

<p>"If the vessel is sighted send a runner to the shore,
and try to get into communication with it, so they
may know where we are.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_47" id="p_47" href="#p_47">p. 47</a></span></p>

<p>"As soon as Tarra returns, send him forward to us
without delay. He should be back before noon to-day."
John was thus precise to deliver the instructions,
because he did not know what their reception
was likely to be at the village.</p>

<p>As stated, his prime object was to prevent the sacrifice
of captives, if such there should be, or to put
off the rites which he knew would take place that day
and the next.</p>

<p>They marched down the hill, taking all precautions
on the way, but they met no opposition. Beyond
them was a well wooded plain, and at intervals they
could see, in the distance, detached huts, and in many
places evidences of crude cultivation of the soil.</p>

<p>The huts were unoccupied, but it was evident from
their appearance that they had been used up to that
very day.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand why no people are living
here," remarked George.</p>

<p>"They have gone to the village to attend the sacred
rites," responded Uraso.</p>

<p>They were now less than a mile from the village,
which could be seen in the distance through the trees.
Something unusual was taking place to their left, and
more than a mile away. Uraso agreed to go in that
direction, and gain the slight elevation, which might
afford him an opportunity to discover the cause of the
excitement.</p>

<p>There was considerable shouting, and then the
beating of the drums, which they had not heard since
the early morning. Uraso was gone not to exceed
a half hour.</p>

<p>"They are having something unusual in that quar<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_48" id="p_48" href="#p_48">p. 48</a></span>ter.
A number of natives have just come in, and a
hundred, or more, from the village met the visitors.
I cannot account for the demonstration," observed
one of the boys.</p>

<p>"It is quite likely," suggested John, "that
some other tribe has come in to attend the ceremonies."</p>

<p>"I do not think so, because the visitors belong to
the same people who live in the village."</p>

<p>John was determined to go on, and they proceeded,
reaching the outlying portion of the village, just as
the visitors, and those from the village were entering
it from the other angle.</p>

<p>"They have a prisoner there," said Muro. "I am
sure that man in the first group is being conducted
to the village."</p>

<p>"Unquestionably, Muro is correct. It is plain
that a party of the villagers have captured the man,
and the excitement we heard was caused by that
fact." And John began to speculate on the probability
of the island containing more than the one
tribe.</p>

<p>"That man is a native, I am sure," was Uraso's
observation.</p>

<p>"That looks like Tarra," said George, in excitement.</p>

<p>This announcement had an electrical effect on
those present. If such should prove to be the case,
what likelihood was there that he had delivered the
message at the landing? Was he captured going,
or coming.</p>

<p>"It looks to me as though he was captured this
morning," observed Harry, "because if he had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_49" id="p_49" href="#p_49">p. 49</a></span>
taken last night, on his way over, they would not
wait until to-day to bring him in."</p>

<p>This looked like a reasonable supposition; but
they must first make sure that it was Tarra.</p>

<p>"Forward march!" said John.</p>

<p>But before they had time to go far the whole town
seemed to be alive. From every part of the village
men were running, and forming in the open space
next the first row of huts.</p>

<p>It was a most curious proceeding that the boys
now witnessed. In the center of the warriors was a
large man, with a curious garb. On each side of
him were noticed men with dissimilar clothing, but
bedecked with every sort of device, the peculiarities
of which could not be distinguished, owing to the
distance.</p>

<p>"That large man in the middle, is the Chief, and
those about him are the witch doctors. The Chief
has brought the witch doctors so as to terrify and destroy
us," and John laughed as he remembered some
of the wiles of that class on Wonder Island.</p>

<p>To the beating of the drums, the Chief marched
forward, his men following, and closing in on his
sides to afford him protection. John motioned
Uraso and Muro to step forward, and they advanced
twenty feet beyond the warriors, and awaited the
Chief.</p>

<p>The latter stopped when within hailing distance,
and John held up a hand. Uraso then addressed the
Chief, telling him that they came as friends, and
not as enemies, and desired to be present at the ceremonies
about to take place.</p>

<p>He also recited that they came from a neighboring<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_50" id="p_50" href="#p_50">p. 50</a></span>
island, where they had a wonderful village, where all
the people were happy, and they now wanted to show,
their friendship by offering presents.</p>

<p>The Chief was silent, and then said: "Why did
you kill my people?"</p>

<p>"We only defended ourselves. Your warriors
were the ones who attacked us. We could have
killed all of your warriors if we had been enemies."</p>

<p>"You speak lies," answered the Chief. "Why
did you take my warrior?"</p>

<p>"Because he was wounded and we are making him
well, and will then return him to you so he can tell
you that what we say is true."</p>

<p>"You are again speaking lies," he retorted. Notwithstanding
the manner in which Uraso had steeled
himself, he was visibly affected by the blunt manner
in which the savage accused him, but he was judicious
enough not to appear disturbed.</p>

<p>"Ask him," said John, "what he wants us to do
to prove that we are friends, and not enemies."</p>

<p>The Chief, at this question, drew himself up
proudly, and answered: "You are on my dominion,
and you have no right to ask any favor from me.
You must deliver yourself up as prisoners, and we
shall then deal with you as we see fit."</p>

<p>"In what way will you deal with us? Have we
committed a wrong? Do you intend to punish us?"</p>

<p>"You had no right to come here. Every one who
does so without my permission, must die."</p>

<p>"Then you expect us to surrender so you may kill
us?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then our Chief tells you that he has a right to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_51" id="p_51" href="#p_51">p. 51</a></span>
come here, and that you have no right to prevent it,
and that if you try to kill us we will have the Great
Spirit visit you the same as he visited your warriors
the other day," said Uraso.</p>

<p>The Chief was astounded at the audacity of the
visitors. He could not understand the presumption
of Uraso, and the defiant attitude of the little group
behind him.</p>

<p>"Then I command the Korinos to destroy you!"
he shouted.</p>

<p>Muro turned to the boys, and smiled as he said:
"Do you know what he means? He calls them Korinos.
On Wonder Island they are Krishnos. That
seems pretty close to the same thing."</p>

<p>Uraso held up a hand, as he said: "I have a
Korino here (pointing to John), and he will destroy
your Korinos."</p>

<p>The witch doctors then ranged themselves in front
of the Chief, and the latter said: "They will sacrifice
your friend who came to us to-day."</p>

<p>To the astonishment of all, Tarra was led forward,
and ordered to kneel down. Then a great
burly man, clothed in the garb so common to the
sorceress among savage tribes, followed him with a
huge knotted club.</p>

<p>"Tell him that if he raises the club I will order the
Korino to die."</p>

<p>This was imparted, but it made no difference to
the executioner. He stepped forward, and slowly
raised the club, but before it had reached its highest
point, a revolver in the hands of John spoke, and
the savage dropped the club, and slowly sank to the
earth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_52" id="p_52" href="#p_52">p. 52</a></span></p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe the consternation
that showed itself at this catastrophe.</p>

<p>"Come here, Tarra," cried John.</p>

<p>Tarra leaped to his feet, and with a few bounds
was at Uraso's side, while Harry jumped forward
and cut the thongs that bound his hands.</p>

<p>The Chief was bewildered, no less than those
around him. No effort was made to prevent Tarra
from escaping. The other Korinos did not even go
forward to the relief of their slain comrade. He lay
there motionless.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said John. "I must have made a
miscalculation, but I am afraid he is dead."</p>

<p>Then one of the Korinos moved toward the fallen
man. "Stop!" cried John. "It will be death for
any one to touch him now!"</p>

<p>Uraso hurriedly informed the Chief of this new
piece of information, which, in reality, caused more
terror than the shot itself. What species of sorcery
was this that they dared not even touch the victim
who disobeyed the white Korino?</p>

<h3>RESCUING A WHITE CAPTIVE</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>"Did</span> you deliver the message at the landing
place?" asked George, after Tarra was freed.</p>

<p>"No; they captured me late last night. I tried for
hours to get through, but they were within a mile of
the landing," answered Tarra.</p>

<p>"But where have you been all this time?"</p>

<p>"They took me north to another village."</p>

<p>But more interesting things were now happening.
The witch doctor who was about to go to his fallen
companion, hesitated. He turned to the Chief.
The latter merely stretched out his hand, and with
an impatient gesture appeared to order him on.</p>

<p>"I warn you!" said Uraso. "It will be death to
touch him."</p>

<p>If there is one thing, more than another, that is
liable to add terror to a low order of human beings,
it is noise. It may be said that the most intelligent
are not entirely devoid of the feeling of fear at inexplainable
noises.</p>

<p>As an example, take the sensations produced by
thunder and lightning, one which affects the ear, and
the other the eye. During a thunderstorm, the feeling
of fear becomes acute only when the roar is
heard.</p>

<p>In this case we know what it is that produces the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_54" id="p_54" href="#p_54">p. 54</a></span>
reverberations; but even under those circumstances
many people are seriously affected by it. A terrific
explosion, of which we do not know the cause, is
often the source of great terror.</p>

<p>This is particularly true with all savage people.
The drums referred to, evidence this particular
feeling of awe, and the louder and more violent, the
more intense is it to the untutored mind. It is with
this idea in their minds that they exercise the bad
spirits by driving them away by making great noises,
a practice true of most savage tribes.</p>

<p>When John returned to Wonder Island from the
United States he had taken with him several of the
well-known Silencers, which, when attached to the
muzzle of a gun, will so deaden the sound that no explosion
is heard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;">
<a id="illus-055" name="illus-055"></a>
<a href="#p_54">
<img src="images/illus-055-fig4.png" width="361" height="111"

</a>
<span class="scribedcaption">Fig. 4. <span class="u">Silencer</span>: <span class="u">Convolute</span> <span class="u">Blades</span>.</span>
</div>

<p>For general use, John knew that the unmuffled
gun would be far more effective than those equipped
with the new invention. Smokeless powder was also
used in the guns which John and his company carried.
The absence of smoke thus centers the mind
of the native on the sound alone, and he sees the
effect on the victim.</p>

<p>To the savage the sound and the effect of the shot
produce the sensation that there is something more
than human in the discharge. It is hard for them<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_55" id="p_55" href="#p_55">p. 55</a></span>
to form an idea of the connection between the report
and the mission of the bullet. It is some monster
which speaks in a loud voice.</p>

<p>But it was more than that to the islanders when
they saw the witch doctor fall. There was a white
Korino who spoke with a voice of thunder. They
were not aware that he held something in his hand
like a weapon, and the noise and the result of that
noise stunned them.</p>

<p>John also carried a revolver with one of the
silencers. When the Korino turned to the Chief,
and the latter, determined not to be swayed by the
power of the white man, there was but one thing for
him to do. He must obey. He knew that if he
shrunk from the task it would be a confession that
his power was gone.</p>

<p>The man approached the prostrate form. "Stop!"
again cried Uraso. "The white Korino will not
again speak, but if he touches the body you will
die!"</p>

<p>He stood there for a moment, irresolute, and then
slowly stooped down, and with hesitation at every
motion, finally touched the figure. In the meantime
John had leveled the revolver with the silencer, and
as the man again rose to an erect position, and
glanced at John defiantly, he quickly threw up his
hands and fell forward across his former companion
with a shot through his arm, as it was not John's
intention to kill him if it could by any possibility be
avoided.</p>

<p>The white Korino had not spoken, as Uraso predicted,
but the results were the same. The savages
who were lined up on both sides of the Chief, began<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_56" id="p_56" href="#p_56">p. 56</a></span>
to waver. They were moving to the rear. The
Korinos around the Chief, finally broke and fled,
and when the people saw this evidence of fear on the
part of their Wise Men, they could not be restrained.</p>

<p>The Chief followed them hurriedly. "Now,
quickly, boys, fire two rounds. No; not at the natives,
but up in the air."</p>

<p>The boys could not understand what John could
mean by such an order, but they did not have an
opportunity to ask the reason for it.</p>

<p>After the volleys John turned to Muro and Uraso,
and remarked: "As soon as the men come up you
and Muro must contrive in some way to find out the
direction that the Korinos have taken."</p>

<p>They now saw the object of the volleys. It would
bring up those of their party who had remained at
the rocky cove. The watch for the Korinos was
equally plain. The experience on Wonder Island
showed that the witch doctors inhabited the caves.</p>

<p>In the excitement they had entirely forgotten this
part of their enterprise. They thought of the treasure.
John had the treasure of the records in his
mind. The hills all about; the limestone formations
of the elevations were ample assurance to his mind
that some caverns would be found; and while they
might, eventually, be able to locate the entrances, it
would be better to find out where they were by watching
and charting the direction they took on their way
to the dark places where they hoped to rest in fancied
security.</p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes their rear guard came into
sight, rushing over the hills, all expectant to find an
enemy in their front. Great was their surprise to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_57" id="p_57" href="#p_57">p. 57</a></span>
see the village beyond, and John and his party bending
over the two bodies, one of them moving and the
other inert. Apparently, he and his force were unconcerned,
although many savages were in the village,
and in plain sight.</p>

<p>An examination of the fallen men made John
happy, because he feared that his aim had been untrue.
Both had been severely wounded, and when
an hour afterwards both men were able to move,
thanks to the knowledge and care of John, they were
carried into the village.</p>

<p>Before this was done, however, John ordered the
force to march boldly into the village. On the approach
of the party the Chief and his followers, together
with the women and children, hurriedly fled
to the north.</p>

<p>Among the huts were found a dozen or more sick
and injured men and women, and a number of old
people who were unable to be carried away. John
went to each, and after carefully examining them,
administered medicine.</p>

<p>In one place they found two warriors, who had
been wounded in the battle four days previously.
These were given special attention, the villagers
meanwhile looking on the proceeding with a feeling
of awe, and wonder. They could not comprehend
the care and treatment which was being given them.</p>

<p>John's companions were most eager to render aid,
and spoke to the patients freely, telling them that
they were friends, and not enemies. During this investigation
into every corner of the village, George
and Harry were the most active. They found many
amusing things, but the care of the sick and the in<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_58" id="p_58" href="#p_58">p. 58</a></span>firm
was the first duty, and they had many willing
helpers.</p>

<p>While thus engaged they reached a long, low
thatched enclosure, so entirely different from the
huts scattered about. There was no visible opening.
They walked around the enclosure with more
and more curiosity. Some of their companions from
Wonder Island then drew near.</p>

<p>"We have found it!" cried one of them.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"This is the place where they keep the captives."</p>

<p>"But how can we get into it?" asked George, then
adding, "Get one of the hatchets, quickly."</p>

<p>Several men ran back and opened the packages
containing their equipment, and others followed to
see the prisoners. Uraso was one of the first to
come up, and he was soon followed by John, all in
excitement over the news. George was the first one
to get a hatchet. He soon chopped a way through,
and Uraso was the first to crawl into the enclosure,
followed by George.</p>

<p>The latter staggered back, as he saw the scene
before him. The enclosure was fully fifteen feet
high, and occupied a space, probably, twenty feet
each way. It was constructed of a species of bamboo,
exceedingly hard, two rows of these paling being
driven into the ground close together, so that it was
impossible to see through the stockade at any point.</p>

<p>Within there was absolutely nothing but the bare
ground, and a mass of indescribable filth, as may
be imagined. Here, lying on the earth, were five
men, with little or no clothing, covered with dirt
and vermin. Two of them were in fairly good con<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_59" id="p_59" href="#p_59">p. 59</a></span>dition,
an evidence that they had not long been prisoners.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; font-size: small;">[<a href="#p_52">See p. 52</a>]</p>
</div>

<p>The other three were emaciated, and what surprised
the boys most was the long, matted and
tangled beard of one of the three. The moment John
saw that form he turned to the boys and fairly
shrieked: "This is a white man. Cut down that
fence, so the men can be taken out, and the moment
they are removed set fire to this place."</p>

<p>The boys could not understand John's vehement
expression.</p>

<p>"Shall we burn the village?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Burn only this enclosure, and don't let
a vestige of it remain."</p>

<p>His orders were quickly carried out. Meanwhile,
not a quarter of a mile away, were the Chief and the
owners of the village, who, upon seeing the smoke and
the flames, appeared to be frantic. No doubt they
regarded it as a sign that the village was doomed,
but they were soon reassured by the time the stockade
was finally consumed, and the few watchers reported
to the Chief that nothing but the prison had been destroyed.</p>

<p>"We have destroyed the Bastille," remarked John,
"and must now take care of the prisoners." They
found that it was indeed a white man who had been
rescued. He was frightfully emaciated, and too
weak to talk.</p>

<p>This was also the condition of the two natives.
The other two were soon restored, after receiving
nourishment, and were ready to tell their story.
They had been taken two weeks previously in a battle
with the tribe to the north.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_60" id="p_60" href="#p_60">p. 60</a></span></p>

<p>Through these men they learned that there were
only two tribes on the island, and that this was by
far the largest, in point of numbers. There had
been continual war between the two people, and the
only thing which saved his tribe from extermination
was the fact that they lived in the mountain regions,
and were thus protected.</p>

<p>This information was very welcome to John and
the boys. The mountains seemed to have a fascination
for them,&mdash;and then, the caves, how could they
forget them now?</p>

<p>For three hours the Chief and his people waited
in the distance. John did not pay any attention to
them, apparently. Shortly thereafter two of his
men came in, dragging one of the former patients.</p>

<p>"We saw him trying to steal away," said one of
the men.</p>

<p>"Was he going toward his people?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then let him go, by all means, and tell him that
we would be glad to have the Chief and his people
return."</p>

<p>The poor fellow was astonished to learn that he
was free. He was as much surprised at this as at
the care which they had bestowed to cure him. He
passed through the village, looking about him with
furtive glances, but, at the command of John, no one
paid any attention to him.</p>

<p>When he reached the Chief there was a long consultation,
and it was evident that a momentous
change was taking place. The Chief could be seen
constantly glancing toward the village, and soon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_61" id="p_61" href="#p_61">p. 61</a></span>
self-imposed messenger returned and approached
John.</p>

<p>"The Chief is willing to see you, and will come to
you, if you wish it." This was imparted to John,
and the latter responded:</p>

<p>"I will go with you."</p>

<p>He called the two chiefs Muro and Uraso, and the
boys, and told them he would go with the messenger
to the Chief, alone, and that they should have no
fear for him.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the messenger, John walked
boldly to the Chief, and going up, pressed his nose
against him, in token of eternal friendship, and then
motioned him to go back to the village.</p>

<p>The Chief was astounded, first, at the bravery of
John in thus coming to him, and in then vowing eternal
friendship.</p>

<p>There is something very peculiar in the characteristics
of savages which forbids them from violating
a peace pledge, or a treaty of friendship when entered
into with the rites that they acknowledge. The
most formal of these rites, is that of rubbing noses
together.</p>

<p>How the custom originated, is not known. It is
something like the kiss, in so far as it is a visible
token of either love, friendship, or esteem. It is
seldom that the savage violates the pledge which is
thus given. John knew this, and felt assured the
great Chief would respect it.</p>

<p>When the latter came into the village, the first
sight that met his eyes, was the demolished stockade.
He looked at it for a moment, in silence. Then some<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_62" id="p_62" href="#p_62">p. 62</a></span>
of the old men came forward, and began to tell him
the wondrous tales of kindness.</p>

<p>The Chief went to his own home, and when he saw
that everything was untouched, and that none of the
people was harmed, he could not understand the actions
of the White Chief, and so expressed his astonishment
to Uraso and Muro. When he was told
that the latter were Chiefs of two tribes on Wonder
Island, he was still more surprised.</p>

<p>"Do you not fight each other?" he asked.</p>

<p>Uraso smiled, as he answered: "Why should
we fight? There is no pleasure in killing, or in causing
suffering. We used to think about those things
as you do."</p>

<p>"What made you think otherwise?"</p>

<p>"The White Chief told us it was wrong, and we
have found that his words were true."</p>

<p>"Where is this place where your tribe may be
found?"</p>

<p>"It is on the other side of the sea, over there,"
answered Uraso, pointing to the west.</p>

<p>"Will it take long to get there?"</p>

<p>"It takes only one sun, and the White Chief would
be so happy to take you there and show you the great
village, and to see the people and the Chiefs who
live together in happiness, and to learn from the
people themselves how they enjoy their homes, and
make the many curious things that the White Chief
has brought over for you."</p>

<p>The Chief looked about him, and finally said: "I
want to see the White Chief."</p>

<p>John had purposely refrained from going to the
Chief's home, but Uraso accompanied him at John's<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_63" id="p_63" href="#p_63">p. 63</a></span>
request, because he was the more diplomatic, and
wielded a stronger influence than Muro, owing to his
remarkable personality.</p>

<p>John was glad of the opportunity, and the boys,
as usual, were also present. The Chief's eyes followed
the two boys, as they entered. He smiled at
them, as John came up and greeted him.</p>

<p>Uraso told John what they had talked about, and
that the Chief was interested in his story of Wonder
Island.</p>

<p>"Our Great Chief will welcome you to Wonder Island,"
said John.</p>

<p>The Chief looked at John for a moment, and then
his eyes wandered to Uraso, as he answered: "Is
there still a greater Chief? Is there a man more
powerful than this Chief?"</p>

<p>Uraso laughed, as did John. "Tell him," said
John, "that our Chief is powerful, because he is
wise."</p>

<p>He did not seem to understand this, and asked for
more information. Uraso told him that the white
man did not regard the strong man as the greatest,
but that the wisest man was always the Chief.</p>

<p>Here was certainly a new philosophy. "But," he
inquired, "then how can he rule his people, if he is
not strong?"</p>

<p>"The people willingly submit to his will because
they know what he says is best for them."</p>

<p>"But does not the Chief sometimes tell them lies,
and does he not often deceive them?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but when they do so then the people choose
another Chief in his place."</p>

<p>"And after they have killed the first Chief, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_64" id="p_64" href="#p_64">p. 64</a></span>
have taken another, and he lies, do they also kill
him?"</p>

<p>"No; they do not kill the Chiefs, but they only put
others in their places."</p>

<p>"Then they are not wise Chiefs?"</p>

<p>"No; they are wise only when they do what is
right."</p>

<p>"Do what is right! What do you mean by that?
How can the Chief do anything but right?"</p>

<p>"Do you think," asked Uraso, "that the Chief has
a right to lie or deceive?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he can do that, but not his people. It is
wrong for them to do so."</p>

<p>"But the white man believes that it is just as
wrong for the Chief to lie and to deceive, as for the
people to do so."</p>

<p>The Chief was silent for a long time, and John
purposely permitted him to reflect on the new dispensation.
While thus musing on the new theory, a
woman carrying a child appeared at the door. John
saw her, and, stepping out, took the child from her
arms. She permitted it, and when the Chief appeared
she fell down and explained that the White
Chief had been very kind to her.</p>

<p>John took some medicine from a small vial, and
administered it, the Chief meanwhile looking on in
astonishment. Here was a great White Chief, looking
out for the comfort of one of the poorest of his
people.</p>

<p>Uraso knew his thoughts. This woman was the
poorest and the lowest in the tribe, and John, without
stopping to make any inquiries as to her condition,
or position in life, had aided her and her old mother.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_65" id="p_65" href="#p_65">p. 65</a></span></p>

<p>Evidently the new doctrine was something so extraordinary,
that it was worth investigating. Uraso
saw the embarrassment in the mind of the Chief, and
after speaking a few words, withdrew.</p>

<p>As they left the Chief's quarters the boys roamed
through the village. The stories of the sufferers
which John had aided, the scrupulous care with
which the men guarded the homes of the villagers
while they were absent, had a most telling effect.</p>

<p>The warriors from Wonder Island mingled with
the villagers. It was singular that there was not
an expression of hatred. They fraternized, and related
stories of Wonder Island, and the people told
them about their own island.</p>

<p>The boys met many of their own ages, and to them
they showed the revolvers, and the marine glasses,
and then astounded them by exhibiting the watches
which they carried.</p>

<h3>RETURN OF THE NATIVES</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>Several</span> of the packages left at the landing place,
contained numerous trinkets, and articles of personal
adornment, such as the natives adored. Brightly-colored
fabrics, made at the factory on Wonder Island
were also among the many articles, which had
been intended to be used as presents.</p>

<p>John was gratified to learn, an hour or two after
the Chief returned, that the latter had given orders
to the villagers to prepare a feast for the visitors.</p>

<p>"But where are the Korinos?" asked George.</p>

<p>True, they had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Let us see John about that," responded Harry.</p>

<p>They had some time in finding him, but later on
learned that he was attending to the wounded, and
caring for the late prisoners.</p>

<p>"It would not be wise to speak to the Chief about
that now," responded John. "The leaven is working
well in his mind. Besides, I fear that he will
wreak vengeance on them, and we must prevent him
from killing them."</p>

<p>As the boys were leaving John they saw fifty of the
warriors leave the Chief's home, marching out of the
village to the east. Muro entered the hut where
John was staying, and announced that the Chief
wished to see him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_67" id="p_67" href="#p_67">p. 67</a></span></p>

<p>John continued with his work, after informing
Muro that he would soon visit the Chief. The boys
later saw John and Muro on their way to the "Palace,"
as Harry called the royal residence, and begged
John's permission to accompany them.</p>

<p>The Chief received them with special marks of attention,
and John thanked him for the invitation.</p>

<p>"This is the day which the Wise Men have appointed
for the sacrifices, and the people are preparing
the feast, in accordance with our custom. It
is my wish that you shall be my guests, and take part
in our ceremonies," remarked the Chief.</p>

<p>Muro, in behalf of John, thanked him for the invitation,
and assured him that they would gladly
join in the rites. Then, he continued: "I wish to
inform you that we left at the seashore, on the other
side of the island, some gifts which I am desirous
of presenting to you. If you will order some of your
men to accompany my guides they will bring them
back."</p>

<p>The Chief's eyes lighted up with pleasure. Immediately,
a detail of men were designated, and a
half dozen of John's warriors, under the leadership
of Muro, were requested to proceed to the landing.</p>

<p>The people saw the company depart with the greatest
wonder and curiosity. Muro was instructed to
leave a message at the landing, and return with the
packages as soon as possible. They reached the
landing place within two hours, and were rejoiced
to see the <i>Pioneer</i> anchored not far from the shore.</p>

<p>Stut was recognized at once, but Sutoto had remained
at Wonder Island. The packages were taken
to the <i>Pioneer</i>, and Muro informed Stut that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_68" id="p_68" href="#p_68">p. 68</a></span>
would sail around the island and land near the village.
The men from the village were awe stricken
at the sight of the vessel, and it was difficult to get
their consent to embarking but were soon persuaded,
when presented with some of the gifts, which Muro
knew would be acceptable.</p>

<hr class='sorta' />

<p>An hour after the last interview in the Chief's
home, the boys saw the warriors, who had formerly
left the Chief's home, marching down the street of
the village, and guarding the Korinos who had
formed part of the Chief's escort earlier in the day.</p>

<p>They were quite different now in demeanor, and
the boys thought they looked crestfallen. They were
ushered into the Chief's presence without any ceremony.</p>

<p>They stood there like criminals, and felt that their
doom was sealed. "I have sent for you," he said,
"because this is the day you have selected for the
ceremonies. Where are the prisoners to be sacrificed?"</p>

<p>They were silent. The Chief continued: "You
have told us that the Great Spirit asks for the sacrifices
each year when the sun is leaving us, and
when the moon is hiding behind the vail. Bring the
captives so they may be offered up."</p>

<p>Instantly the Korinos brightened up, and muttered
a few words. The Chief gave an order, and they
were marched out of the building. Out of curiosity,
the boys followed. Their steps were directed to the
stockade where the prisoners had been confined.</p>

<p>To their dismay they saw only the ashes, and were
staggered at the sight. They stood there with won<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_69" id="p_69" href="#p_69">p. 69</a></span>dering
eyes. The boys could see that this was a condition
wholly unexpected by them, and it must be
said that there was pity in the hearts of Harry and
George, as the leader gave the order for them to return
to the "Palace."</p>

<p>As they entered John and the Chief were engaged
in an animated conversation, and when the latter
saw the Korinos, he stood up and asked for the victims.</p>

<p>"They are not there!" was the only response.</p>

<p>The Chief, not affecting to believe, told them that
they were lying to him. They fell to their knees,
but were mute.</p>

<p>"But the Great Spirit must not be deceived.
Great evil will fall upon us if he is not appeased.
If you cannot find the victims I will do so."</p>

<p>The Chief's voice was terrible in its anger. Outside
of their dark homes the Korinos were subject
to the Chief's will. Within the caves they knew no
fear. The boys looked at Uraso and John. A slight
smile could be seen on Uraso's face, as he returned
the gaze of the boys; but John's face was immobile,
and did not in the least appear to portray any concern.</p>

<p>"It is my order that you shall be the victims, and
must be offered up as the sacrifices to prevent the
anger of the Great Spirit."</p>

<p>This doom was pronounced in a voice so full of
anger that its significance was instantly divined by
the boys, although they could not understand all of
the words which he uttered.</p>

<p>They were instantly seized and bound, and being
now in a helpless condition, were carried out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_70" id="p_70" href="#p_70">p. 70</a></span>
building, and, with the most brutal force conveyed
by the guard to a hut not far from the Palace, and
literally thrust into the small opening which formed
the entrance.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they will kill them?" asked
Harry, as he moved to the side of Uraso.</p>

<p>"I think the Chief means what he says," and
Uraso gave a little smile that somewhat assured
them.</p>

<p>"No; I don't think John will let the Chief kill
them," responded George.</p>

<p>After the removal of the Korinos John asked
whether it would be possible to defer the ceremonies
until the following day, for the reason that he desired
to distribute the gifts which the men were
bringing from the landing.</p>

<p>"If the White Chief so desires it shall be done."</p>

<p>John manifested his pleasure at the consent thus
obtained.</p>

<p>George and Harry now wandered into every part
of the village. For the first time they noticed that
it was located at the western edge of a beautiful
grove, thickly wooded, with tall trees.</p>

<p>Through this they walked, and before they
emerged were delighted at the sight of the great
ocean beyond. "I wonder if John knows we are so
near?"</p>

<p>They ran to the beach, delighted to have an opportunity
for a bath, but were surprised to see many
along the shore with small bags.</p>

<p>"They are searching for something," remarked
Harry. "I wonder what it can be?"</p>

<p>"Possibly clams. Don't you remember the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_71" id="p_71" href="#p_71">p. 71</a></span>
week when we lived on clams, after we reached Wonder
Island? What delightful days we had; and how
afraid we were of every noise, and used to start up at
every new sound."</p>

<p>"And wasn't it a joy to make the new things, and
see every day bring new wonders to us after we
moved to the Cataract?"</p>

<p>"I have a love for that old home. We were so
happy there. I know I am not happier now when
we own all the treasures of the caves, than when we
were building the water wheel, and the little shop,
and tending the yaks," answered George, as he gazed
across the sea, and thought of the glorious times and
of their wonderful adventures.</p>

<p>When they saw the streams of people coming from
the shore they recalled that the people were preparing
for the feast. It was remarkable that clams
were an article of food with these people when those
on the island they had just left, despised all fish
and sea food.</p>

<p>They wandered along the beach, fully a mile south
of the village, and quite out of reach of the people,
and were soon in the mild surf. After a half hour
of this enjoyment they dressed, and ascended a slight
elevation from which could be seen the character of
the land along the sea.</p>

<p>To the north and south of their position the land
was much higher, the northern portion having the
appearance of very high hills, if not mountains.</p>

<p>"Do you think John was thinking about the caves
when the guards brought in the Korinos?" remarked
George, as they were descending the ridge.</p>

<p>"I thought of it," answered Harry. "But I<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_72" id="p_72" href="#p_72">p. 72</a></span>
learned from Muro that he knew where they made
their homes!"</p>

<p>"Then he must have watched them, as John suggested!"</p>

<p>"No; one of the men told him just before he left."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"That they should follow the trail to the north of
the grove until they reached the sea."</p>

<p>"Then Muro must know that the sea is near?"</p>

<p>"I think he does."</p>

<p>During the descent from the hill the ocean was
visible directly to the east. Both, at the same instant,
caught sight of a sail. They gasped in surprise,
as they gazed at the unusual spectacle.</p>

<p>"I would like to know who that can be," queried
Harry. "Let us tell John and then get something
so we can signal it."</p>

<p>They rushed down the hill, and ran hurriedly
through the streets of the village, to the surprise
of the inhabitants. First going to the Chief's house,
without finding him, they went to the improvised
hospital where the wounded Korinos were being
cared for.</p>

<p>There John was found, together with Uraso and
the Chief. "We have seen a sail," shouted George.
"We want something to use as a signal." John
bounded up, and Uraso rushed out and soon fished
out a white cloth, and ran down through the grove
after the boys.</p>

<p>Three hundred feet to the right was a slight elevation,
which the boys had noticed, and as it was devoid
of trees offered the most available place for the
signal flag. They scurried around for some pole<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_73" id="p_73" href="#p_73">p. 73</a></span>
which would answer, and to this the white cloth was
quickly attached.</p>

<p>John was the last to reach the signaling point.
He was laughing immoderately, as he noticed the
frantic signaling. "Where are your field glasses,
George?"</p>

<p>"They are in the village. I forgot about them."</p>

<p>"If you had used them you would not be surprised
at the visitor."</p>

<p>The boys stopped signaling for a moment, and
then looked at the ship.</p>

<p>"It isn't possible that is the <i>Pioneer</i>?"</p>

<p>"Look again, for yourself; don't you know your
own work?"</p>

<p>The ship had seen the signal, and now turned.
Then they recognized the grand little vessel, that
was almost a part of themselves, for they had worked
many months to complete her, and had tried to put
good luck and best wishes into every plank and spar
and sail.</p>

<p>The Chief, too, was coming. The whole village
joined to welcome the ship, for when Uraso told the
Chief that their own ship was coming, he could not
resist the temptation to witness the arrival.</p>

<p>Was it possible that Muro reached the landing
place before the ship left? John thought so, but the
boys doubted it. Muro left before noon, and it was
now past five in the evening.</p>

<p>As the vessel neared the shore the people lined up
and the boys crowded close to the shore. They were
the first to recognize Muro, to their great delight.
He waved his hand to them, and Stut was by his
side.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_74" id="p_74" href="#p_74">p. 74</a></span></p>

<p>"Good old Stut!" shouted George. "Where is
Sutoto?"</p>

<p>"In Wonder Island!" was the response.</p>

<p>They were disappointed at this, but there was too
much for them to think about, as the anchor was being
swung, and as soon as it dropped, a boat was lowered
from each side, and the men began to descend
from the short ladder, while the village people
watched the proceeding with silent wonderment.</p>

<p>Muro was the first to touch the shore, and then
came the villagers who were on the mission with
Muro. They were the heroes to their friends. They
knew their duty to their Chief, however, and the latter
had a most animated conversation with them, and
particularly so after he had noticed the array of
trinkets which Muro had bestowed on them.</p>

<p>While this was going on the boats returned and
bundles and packages were brought out of the ship
and deposited in the boats. After they had been
taken from the boats, John said: "With your permission
I will take these things to your house."</p>

<p>The Chief assented, and on his orders the men in
the village gathered up the assortment of gifts and
the procession filed along the path to the village.</p>

<p>The feast that evening reminded them of the welcome/
which the Chief Beralsea extended to them the
second night after their arrival at Venture Island.
Besides the clams referred to there was an abundance
of fish, several varieties, besides game and
meats, and the only thing which they seemed to lack,
or which was rather meager in quantity, was fruit.</p>

<p>Like all natives of these islands, they were experts
at spitting the meats. The most delicious was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_75" id="p_75" href="#p_75">p. 75</a></span>
species of ground hog, that the boys frequently
caught on Wonder Island. The boys had watched
the method of roasting these animals.</p>

<p>A strong green tapering stick, about four feet
long was selected, and the bark was peeled off, so as
to give it a smooth surface. The small end of this
was sharpened, and driven through the animal, from
end to end, so that it was held firmly on the stick,
midway between its ends.</p>

<span class="scribedcaption">Fig. 5. <span class="u">Spitting</span> <span class="u">the</span> <span class="u">Roast</span>.</span>
</div>

<p>Two forked posts were then driven into the
ground, about three feet apart, and the stick laid
in the forks. A fire of wood, previously built between
the posts was permitted to accumulate a quantity
of coal, and when a hot fire was thus generated,
one of the natives would continuously rotate the stick,
so that the heat affected all sides evenly, and the
result would be the most tempting roast imaginable.
This is a practice common with savages all over the
world, varying only in the details of the preparations.</p>

<p>All the vegetables were roasted, in hot coals. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_76" id="p_76" href="#p_76">p. 76</a></span>
this respect their custom was different from the practice
followed in Venture Island, for there they knew
how to make stews. Here they knew nothing about
pottery, but like all islanders in the South Seas, the
wrecks would, occasionally cast cooking utensils, like
pots, or pans, ashore, and these highly-prized articles
were sure to be taken by the Chiefs, or by the Krishnos
themselves, where they could get them by stealth.</p>

</div>

<p>Unlike the natives of Wonder Island, they had potatoes,
the wild variety which the boys found the second
day after they were cast ashore. The Taro root,
that vegetable which grows in the greatest abundance
in every section south of the Equator, to the lower
border of the south temperate zone, was the chief
dish, and was also roasted in like manner.</p>

<p>What surprised them most was a drink that
pleased John, who at once recognized its origin.
They called it Arialad, and George declared it was a
fine quality of Sarsaparilla.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_77" id="p_77" href="#p_77">p. 77</a></span></p>

<p>"You are correct," said John. "Its real botanical
name is Arialace. It belongs to the same family
as spikenard and ginseng. Very few natives know
of its value. It is both a medicine and a refreshing
drink."</p>

<p>"If it grows in abundance here it would be a good
thing to gather for export," observed Harry.</p>

<p>"A boat load of the roots would be worth a fortune,"
rejoined John.</p>

<p>There was the utmost good fellowship among all
present. In accordance with the custom among most
of these people the women did not partake of the
food in the presence of the men. They acted as the
servants in serving the food, but the men prepared
the meal, a sort of well-balanced family arrangement,
as George observed.</p>

<p>"But who washes the dishes?" asked Harry with a
laugh, in which all joined.</p>

<h3>THE SAVAGE CEREMONIALS</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>The</span> next day was the one appointed for the ceremonies.
The boys were expectant, because during
all their experiences in the islands, this was the first
time they had an opportunity to witness one of these
spectacles.</p>

<p>It was noticed that no preparations were made for
a morning meal by the natives. All were specially
garbed for the occasion, if the colored decorations
counted for anything in the way of additional clothing.</p>

<p>They were adept in the art of weaving cloth,
which was made in small sections, and sewn together,
similar to the practice in most of these primitive
countries. They were not altogether devoid of
knowledge pertaining to dyes, the most frequent being
blue, which John soon ascertained came from
some copper deposits.</p>

<p>The Madder plant was the most common on the
island, and this afforded a red color, the most lasting
of all dyes, and the most generally in use throughout
the civilized world, until the aniline dyes took
its place.</p>

<p>For black they resorted to the common method
of using carbon which is the stock material in our
own country. This was produced by them from<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_79" id="p_79" href="#p_79">p. 79</a></span>
burnt wood, and not from any of the coal products.</p>

<p>Their faces were painted a hideous red and blue,
principally in the nature of great zig-zag stripes, and
the exposed parts, of the bodies were of diverse figures,
some of them really artistic. The preparation
of these personal decorations consumed the greater
portion of the night, as the boys afterwards learned.</p>

<p>When they emerged from their hut in the morning,
and saw the grotesque figures all about the village,
they could hardly repress a smile; but as every one
was smiling and happy, they did not have to make
any pretentions, but smiled and laughed as the men
and women circled about, because they couldn't help
themselves.</p>

<p>The women were not so gaudily attired as the men.
Their decorations were expended on clothing, as it
was not considered good form to decorate their
bodies.</p>

<p>All the men carried spears, and many of them were
wicked-looking instruments. What surprised them
was the fact that all the spear-points were now covered
over, or bound up by colored material, forming
a sort of sphere, to which three colored streamers
were attached, one white, one red and the other blue.</p>

<p>"My, but they are patriotic!" remarked George, as
he saw the design and the streamers.</p>

<p>John smiled, as he observed them. "But do you
notice that the point of the spear is covered?"</p>

<p>"I was about to ask the meaning of that," said
Harry.</p>

<p>"This is the day of feasting and of sacrifices.
The covered point indicates that there is peace; and
that no one can commit an injury. I imagine the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_80" id="p_80" href="#p_80">p. 80</a></span>
points will be uncovered quickly enough the moment
they are ready for the sacrifices."</p>

<p>"I am more interested in the fact that they use the
American colors. I wish we had one of the flags
here. That idea has just struck me as being the
proper thing." And George danced about at the
scheme.</p>

<p>Harry was just as much affected now. "Why not
consult Uraso and Muro, and bring over the big flag
from the ship?"</p>

<p>John laughed at the idea. "A brilliant idea. The
flag will be a big attraction, but I warn you that if
you get it I shall have to insist that you must head
the procession with it."</p>

<p>"Are we going to have a procession?"</p>

<p>"I believe that is the first thing on the list."</p>

<p>"But where is the procession going? Is it the
custom to march along the principal streets and out
along the boulevards?"</p>

<p>This idea was so laughable to Harry and Uraso
and Muro, that they had a fit of laughter. The two Chiefs
were just like boys, and entered in to the spirit
of the undertaking with a vim that pleased the boys.</p>

<p>They fairly flew to the landing, and manned the
boat. "We have come for the flag," announced
George, as Stut was looking on the excitable boys.</p>

<p>"Why not take both of them?" responded Stut.</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered Harry. "I had forgotten
about the other. And while we are about it, why not
have the band come along?"</p>

<p>This was answered by a shout. One of the new
acquirements of the natives of Wonder Island, was
music, and when the boys returned from the States<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_81" id="p_81" href="#p_81">p. 81</a></span>
they brought along several fine sets of band instruments,
one set of which was always on the vessel, and
was used for evening concerts.</p>

<p>"Where is Mano?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>Mano was the leader of the ship's band, but he was
not to be found.</p>

<p>"John sent for Mano an hour ago, and he is now
in the village."</p>

<p>"Then send for him at once. Tell him he must
be here as soon as John is through with him," said
George.</p>

<p>While the flags were being wrapped up one of the
small boats came from the shore, and Mano stepped
out.</p>

<p>Harry ran up and said: "Get the boys and the
instruments ready. You must play for us to-day
during the ceremonies."</p>

<p>Mano smiled as he answered: "John told me
about it last night, and I went over merely to find
out what music I should take."</p>

<p>"So John tried to steal a march on us?" remarked
Harry. "How soon will you be ready?"</p>

<p>"We are all ready now. I was told at the Chief's
house that the procession would start in a half hour."</p>

<p>When the flags were brought out it was Mano's
time to stare. "I think," he said, "that will surprise
John, but the idea is a proper one."</p>

<p>The band comprised nine musicians and the
two drummers. The moment they landed the band
formed four abreast, and directly behind were the
two boys with the Stars and Stripes. To the tune
of "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean," they marched
straight to the home of the Chief.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_82" id="p_82" href="#p_82">p. 82</a></span></p>

<p>The crashing music, and the magnificent flags
brought pandemonium to that savage village. Nothing
like it had ever been known before. Long before
the band reached the Palace all the inhabitants of the
town had rushed down, and at Uraso's and Muro's
suggestion the people followed behind, and thus made
a procession which was the most unique that it was
possible to describe.</p>

<p>"That scheme will make a success of the ceremonies,"
remarked George, almost too full for utterance.
"Why the thing wouldn't be a success without
the flags and the music."</p>

<p>"I wonder how the thing will fit in when it comes
to the sacrifices this afternoon? I imagine the
Korinos ought to feel like dying when they are to
have such an unusual funeral procession?" Harry
said this with a bit of irony, as he turned to George
and grinned at the idea.</p>

<p>John knew what was coming, but the Chief didn't.
He and John came out together, when they heard the
music. The boys, behind the band could not see the
great sights that were taking place in the rear, but
John stood there beside the big Chief, and was simply
convulsed with laughter.</p>

<p>The natives were not walking. They were dancing,
and the Chief, at first astounded at the music,
and at the waving flags, soon joined John in laughter
as they witnessed this remarkable scene.</p>

<p>Uraso had taken part in numerous celebrations at
Unity, and knew what disposition to make of the people
when they arrived. The band marched past, and
John raised his hand in the form of a salutation,
and the Chief noticing this imitated him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_83" id="p_83" href="#p_83">p. 83</a></span></p>

<p>"The old fellow is learning rapidly how to do the
correct thing," suggested Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes; John will have him in a swallow-tail coat
before night."</p>

<p>The band marched past, and then turned around
and came back, and as fast as the people came up
Uraso and Muro directed them where to stand, so
that when the band stopped they formed a large
semi-circle facing the Chief and John.</p>

<p>The boys walked forward so they stood with the
flags midway between the band and the Chief. The
latter motioned for the band to continue. John understood,
and a new tune was struck up. The Chief
was fascinated. When that tune was concluded, the
Chief wanted another, quite forgetting the importance
of the ceremonial rites.</p>

<p>While the last tune was being played the boys saw
a tall man, with a huge spear, and a face most hideously
painted. His body had characteristic stripes,
entirely unlike those of the other people. Behind
him marched the Korinos, without a sign or mark on
them different from the costumes worn by them on
the preceding day.</p>

<p>As they filed along behind the leader, the boys
noticed that the first one carried a thong-like rope:
the second a knife; the third a sort of vessel, and the
fourth a pair of short sticks.</p>

<p>The people paid no attention to them, while the
band was playing, but when it ceased, it was evident
that they shrunk back from these dreaded men.</p>

<p>John beckoned Uraso and Muro to come forward,
and the Chief welcomed them. "As chiefs of your
tribes you should be here with us. The White Chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_84" id="p_84" href="#p_84">p. 84</a></span>
tells me that in his country the band and the flag always
go first, and I have asked him to tell us how we
should march to the forest."</p>

<p>John then told those present how the procession
should form. The band was marched to the front,
and George, who had the small flag, was placed directly
behind the band. Then the Chief, with Uraso
and Muro on either side, and directly behind them
Harry took position with the large flag.</p>

<p>After the flag the Korinos, without their tall
leader, however, were placed in line. John then motioned
to the people to take their places following the
Korinos, and the moment the column was thus formed
the band struck up a lively marching tune, and John
accompanied by the tall fantastic leader, went ahead
of the band.</p>

<p>The leader knew, of course, where the procession
must go, and he thus wisely made the arrangement
for the occasion. The procession wended its way directly
to the north, along a well-beaten path, and
after ascending a hill, turned to the left, and entered
a sort of grove.</p>

<p>The boys were delighted to notice the magnificent
Magnolia trees in full bloom, the flowers of which
surpassed anything they had ever seen, and the perfume
was almost overpowering in its intensity.</p>

<p>To the boys this peculiar procession had something
mysterious about it. Neither John, nor the two
Chiefs had any idea of its significance. John directed
a questioning look toward the articles which
the Korinos carried.</p>

<p>When the crest of the hill was reached they made
one complete circle, and the head of the column<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_85" id="p_85" href="#p_85">p. 85</a></span>
stopped before the most magnificent magnolia tree
in the grove. The leader marched along the line
and the people soon formed themselves into a circle
with the tree in the center.</p>

<p>All chatter had stopped. While ascending the hill,
and up to this time, there was a never ending clatter
of voices; but now all were quiet, and gazed to the
top of the tree. The tall leader, at the nod of the
Chief came forward and approached the tree, and
with the long spear struck it three times, and then
turned to the Korinos, who had now followed him.</p>

<p>Then, he turned again, and struck the tree three
times more, and this was repeated the third time.
After stepping back he raised the spear, and held it
over the head of the Korino who carried the rope.
The latter stepped to the tree and with a dextrous
throw sent a coil of rope over the first limb and
caught the other end of it.</p>

<p>The spear was then laid over the head of the man
with the knife, and he sprang forward grasping the
rope, and when the spear was poised on high, he
gracefully crept hand over hand up the rope.</p>

<p>The instant the man's hand seized the rope the
people fell to the ground and covered their faces.
The boys did not want to lose this part of the ceremony,
you may be sure, but they tried to observe
the rites.</p>

<p>A side glance was sufficient to assure them that the
Chief did not kneel, nor did either John, Uraso or
Muro; but they were privileged characters, so the
boys went through the ceremony by peering through
their fingers, and at the same time trying to find out
whether there were not others trying to do the same.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_86" id="p_86" href="#p_86">p. 86</a></span></p>

<p>The man went up and up, and soon emerged from
the last spare branches at the top, until his face was
near the great white flower which grew on the tip.</p>

<p>"I think that is the flower all the people were looking
at," said George in a whisper.</p>

<p>The man raised the knife, and with one slash
severed the stem. Then, raising himself up to his
full height, so his body could be plainly seen, he
waved the flower about his head three times, and the
leader at the base of the tree again struck the trunk
three times.</p>

<p>Immediately the people arose and placed their
hands before them exactly like a bather on a perch
about to dive, and with the palms of the hands thus
placed against each other, the arms were raised to a
vertical position, and lowered three times.</p>

<p>With hands still in their lowered position, and eyes
cast on the ground, the Korino in the tree slowly descended,
and the one who threw the rope quickly detached
it from the tree.</p>

<p>The spear was then placed over the head of the
man with the sticks. He crossed his legs and sat
down, and with an exceedingly rapid motion, soon
caused smoke to arise, and then a tiny flame appeared.</p>

<p>"Why didn't they tell us about it, and we could
have let them use some of our matches," said George
dryly, as Harry made a great show of indignation
at the irrelevant remark.</p>

<p>A fire was quickly kindled, and the man with the
bowl knelt down, after fixing two stones on opposite
sides of the fire. From a small receptacle he
took a powder, and dropped it into the bowl, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_87" id="p_87" href="#p_87">p. 87</a></span>
after holding the flower aloft, the man who took it
from the tree, dropped it into the smoking bowl.</p>

<p>Instantly the people resumed their natural poses,
and began to dance. The Chief spoke a word to
Uraso, and the band struck up a lively tune. Then,
to the ringing blare of the band, and the shrieks
and shouts of the people the dance began. It was
one continuous whirl, and many of them became
frenzied.</p>

<p>The Chief himself participated in this part of the
ceremony, and swung himself around and around in
a giddy whirl. During all this time each fellow was
for himself. They did not have partners as in the
civilized dances.</p>

<p>The tangoing was an individual effort, and each
enjoyed it in his own way, but they all kept step to
the music, showing the savage characteristic of being
able to observe rhythmic effects.</p>

<p>The boys caught the spirit of the occasion, and
joined in the wild swirl. Uraso and Muro were at it,
and the sole spectator was John, who said that he felt
too old to learn the new steps.</p>

<p>When the band stopped the people rested, but there
was no disposition to break up the merry party, and
when the music again struck up the whole scene was
acted over again. It was noon before the grand ball
ceased.</p>

<p>Then, at a sign from the Chief the procession reformed,
and went back over the trail, the people
dancing all the way, and, apparently, without exhibiting
any signs of weariness, although it must be stated
that the band was nearing collapse, when the people
dispersed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>SIGNIFICANCE OF NATIVE RITES</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>As</span> heretofore stated, there had been no morning
meal, and the dancing must have been a trying task,
under those conditions.</p>

<p>"It would have been much better if we had something
to eat before this part of the ceremony. I am
so hungry I could eat anything," remarked George,
as they neared the village.</p>

<p>"The natives do not think so. That is part of the
ceremony. It must be carried out before a meal is
taken," answered John, "or it will not have the
proper effect."</p>

<p>Uraso overheard the remark, and he added:
"The Chief said they had never known such a scene
as took place to-day, and that it was not a part of
the regular ceremony to have the dancing at that
time, but that the wonderful music seemed to win
every one."</p>

<p>"I heard him say it was the first time in years
that he had danced. How he enjoyed it," remarked
Muro. "I admit that it was the best dance I had
since the boys got back. That was a big time at
Unity when you returned."</p>

<p>"I think," said Harry, "that was the queerest performance
I ever heard of. What a foolish thing to
cut a flower from the top of a tree, and go through<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_89" id="p_89" href="#p_89">p. 89</a></span>
all that ceremony, using Old Fantastic with his flourishing
spear to conduct the ridiculous rites."</p>

<p>"Do you think it is any more foolish than many
things which civilized people do?" asked John.</p>

<p>Harry mused a while, and then continued: "Probably
not, when I think of it, but with us the ceremonies
really mean something; at least, it seems
to me that they are intended to."</p>

<p>"Yes, and that is generally so with the native rites.
Sometimes the origin is rather obscure, but everything
of this character comes from something in the
past, of which it is symbolic. Spencer, in his work
on 'Evolutions of Ceremonial Forms of Government,'
recites a curious instance of this, where he
shows that the habit of stroking the mustache is a
survival of scalping."</p>

<p>The boys laughed. "That must be pretty well
far-fetched," responded George.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" answered John. "He reasons
it in this way. It was, formerly the custom, among
most savage tribes, to take the hair of victims, to be
used as personal adornment, or to indicate the valor
of the warrior. Among some tribes in the Philippines
and also in the interior of Africa, the custom
is to take the head of an enemy."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the Head hunters?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you have probably heard a great deal about
them since we acquired the Philippines. When men
began to get a little higher in the scale of civilization,
the victor required some token of submission from
the conquered, so the latter plucked a wisp of hair
from his head and presented it to indicate defeat.
During the seventeenth century it was the rule of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_90" id="p_90" href="#p_90">p. 90</a></span>
Spanish Court that all inferiors, in addressing superiors,
must stroke the mustache, and this came
from the old idea of the hair token."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose that the taking of the flower has
any particular significance?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly! There must be a flower before
there can be fruit. This is the beginning of the season
or the beginning of the year, to these people,
and the largest-flower, at the top of the greatest
tree is the one taken while it is at full bloom, and
incinerated."</p>

</div>

<p>"Is that what they did in that bowl-shaped vessel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I imagine they will use the ashes in some
part of their rites."</p>

<p>"Did you ever know of other tribes that do anything
like that?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_91" id="p_91" href="#p_91">p. 91</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; very many; in fact most savage tribes have
some sort of rites which they scrupulously follow
out as a religious duty. Ancient history records
many such practices in detail. Thus, the Druids,
a peculiar class, or order of priests, which existed
among the Celtic races, attributed a sacred or mystic
character to plants, and venerated the oak tree."</p>

<p>"I have read that they offered up human sacrifices,"
said Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes; I was coming to that. But do you know
that they regarded the mistletoe as an antidote
for all poisons and a cure for all diseases?
At certain seasons in the year it would be
gathered, and with the greatest ceremonies one of
the priests would ascend the tree on which it was
found, and cut it off with a golden knife."</p>

<p>"But is the mistletoe found on the Oak?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but it grows more frequently on the Apple
tree. The seeds are distributed by birds, and owing
to the fact that it is found so infrequently on the
oak, the Druids considered it peculiarly sacred on
that account."</p>

<hr class='sorta' />

<p>The delicious odor of the roasted food, which met
the people on their return, was a compensation for
the lack of the morning breakfast. The Chief had
invited John, Uraso, Muro, the two boys, and Stut,
to accompany him to his home.</p>

<p>There in the open court, if it might so be called,
were the viands in the greatest profusion. They
were surprised to see that at each place was a couch,
and before every visitor was laid a bountiful supply
of food. In all their wanderings George and Harry<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_92" id="p_92" href="#p_92">p. 92</a></span>
never ate with a greater relish than on the present
occasion.</p>

<p>The meal the previous day, was not at all comparable
to this. It would have vied with many a
meal set before our civilized gastronomies. The
table implements, it is true, were not found in profusion,
but the wooden forks, or prongs were good
substitutes for the more refined articles, and for
plates hollowed bark sections were found serviceable.</p>

<p>The Sarsaparilla drink was the most favored
liquid. "I wish we had some ice for it," suggested
Harry. "It will be a good thing to bring over some
ice for the Chief. I think he would enjoy it."</p>

<p>"By the way, Harry, did you see what they did
with the Korinos?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Shut them up in that dark hole back of the
house."</p>

<p>"I wonder if they have given them anything to
eat?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Muro. "They are to be sacrificed
this afternoon, and it wouldn't do to feed them."</p>

<p>"Poor fellows!" remarked George, as he gazed
vacantly before him, lost in contemplation.</p>

<p>"Well, they have been found out, and will now be
dealt with in accordance with their law."</p>

<p>"Was that tall fellow one of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he is the principal chief of the Korinos. Do
you know they tried to escape last night?" exclaimed
Uraso.</p>

<p>"Is that so? Where could they go in safety on
this island?"</p>

<p>"To their caves, of course," remarked Harry.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_93" id="p_93" href="#p_93">p. 93</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," added Uraso, "the Chief has no authority
under ground."</p>

<p>The people gorged; so did the Chief. The meal
was a course dinner, at least so far as the time it
took to get through with all the dishes, and the boys
smiled as they saw the Chief slowly sink down, and
pass off into oblivion.</p>

<p>John sat there, gazing on him, and slowly nodding
his head at the spectacle. He did not evince disgust,
and when George spoke to him about this peculiar
savage trait, he remarked: "Is he any worse than
many people in our own country, who do the same
thing? This is not gluttony with the savage; he
knows no better. This is one of the great enjoyments
of life which the savage knows. Teach him
something better and he will respond."</p>

<p>"When you stop to think of it," replied George,
"I really don't see why it is such an awful thing to
eat until you are stuffed to sleepiness?"</p>

<p>"The real argument against it is on sanitary
grounds," suggested John. "We regard gluttony
as bad because it is a selfish exhibition of taste and
habits, and in this I quite agree; but among savages
the custom of regularity in habits is not one of their
understood laws. I have known North American
Indians who could each devour from six to eight
pounds of beef, and drink two quarts of coffee at one
sitting. But those men would not eat another meal
for three days."</p>

<p>During the meal hour there was a continual round
of merriment, and every one was enjoying himself
to the fullest extent. But now the hum of voices
ended. The boys were surprised.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_94" id="p_94" href="#p_94">p. 94</a></span></p>

<p>"They are taking their noon-day siestas," said
John, laughing.</p>

<p>The boys arose and passed out. It was true, indeed.
The men, and women too, were taking naps
everywhere, the grotesque figures lying where they
had eaten their food.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;">

</div>

<p>They made a tour. No one appeared to take any
notice of them, as they passed through the open
places between the huts, because all of the food was
eaten in the open, and not within the huts. The village
looked like one immense picnic ground.</p>

<p>As they were returning toward the Chief's house
they caught sight of the hut in which the Korinos
were confined. To their astonishment two of them
were crawling out the enclosure, and the leader was
particularly noticeable, peering from the side of the
hut.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_95" id="p_95" href="#p_95">p. 95</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall we give the alarm?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"No, no! See John; he will know what to do."</p>

<p>As they passed the hut the guards lay in blissful
sleep, and seeing this the boys rushed in and excitedly
told John of the jail delivery and the advisability
of giving the alarm.</p>

<p>He held up his hand, in caution, as he smiled at
the announcement. "Do you want the poor fellows
to be sacrificed?"</p>

<p>"By no means."</p>

<p>"Then let them go. Possibly the Chief may find
some way to get them back."</p>

<p>Two hours later the village took on another aspect.
It was now about five o'clock in the afternoon, but
in the meantime boy-like they had investigated every
part of the surrounding scenery, being particularly
interested in the monkeys which were seen in the
trees everywhere.</p>

<p>The most amusing to the boys was a small animal
that had a "beard all around his face," as George
expressed it. It was small, hardly exceeding a foot
in height, a sort of olive-gray color, and a round tail
twice the length of the body.</p>

<p>"I think I know what you have reference to," suggested
John, when appealed to. "It is the Jacchus,
and is related to the Marmozets and the Tamarins.
They are very active, like squirrels, and live on nuts,
seeds, roots and fruit."</p>

<p>The Chief awakened as the boys entered, and
within the next half hour was ready for the continuance
of the festival.</p>

<p>"I should like to know what the next thing is on
the programme? This is a little inconvenient, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_96" id="p_96" href="#p_96">p. 96</a></span>
knowing just what is going to take place," was
George's observation.</p>

<p>"John will know if any one does, but I suppose he
is too busy now with his Royal Highness," answered
Harry with a laugh.</p>

<p>But the boys were not kept long in suspense. The
natives understood, as it appeared, for they were
soon congregated around the Palace, and now for
the first time the boys noticed a large, imposing-looking
native, who carried an immense knotted club.
To satisfy the reader's curiosity, it may be well to
describe him. He wore a loin cloth, made of the
skins of the small animals which were found all over
the island, and, to all appearances, at least a half
dozen different kinds of pelts were used to make up
the garment, the ends, or corners of which hung down
in points to form a fringe.</p>

<p>At his ankles were two huge bands, made of cloth,
and plentifully decorated with spangles of shells,
and rows of nuts, strung on cords, like beads.
Around his neck and trailing down the back was a
collar of interwoven leaves, very artistically arranged,
if judged from the viewpoint of savage decorations.</p>

<p>The head dress was unique, being made up of a
band of coarsely-woven cloth, literally covered with
large fish scales, and a pyramidal structure was fastened
to this band, and extended up beyond the crown
for a foot, or more. At its apex was a mass of
streamers, which fluttered around as the breeze
floated by.</p>

<p>The weapon was fully five feet long, the head of
the club, for such it was, terminated in a gnarled<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_97" id="p_97" href="#p_97">p. 97</a></span>
knot, bristling with small points. This the boys recognized
to be somewhat similar to the wicked thing
that was carried by the Korino when he sought to
slay Tarra.</p>

<p>The Chief was also differently attired. He was
literally covered with clothing, the different parts
being dyed with various colors without any regard
to harmony, or design. Like all the others he wore
no foot covering, but had bare feet.</p>

<p>The crown was also a cloth band, but this was
surrounded by vertically-arranged thorns, huge
things that showed their bristling points, and wound,
or rather braided around them, were garlands of human
hair, of different hues.</p>

<p>The Royal wand was an immense black staff, fully
two inches thick, and six feet long, one end of which
was pointed, the other end terminating within a large
calabash. This wand he held with the pointed end
upward.</p>

<p>When he appeared at the doorway the people fell
down on their faces, and after a few words all arose,
and the man with the club turned toward the hut
where the Korinos were confined. Four of the
largest warriors accompanied him, while the people
looked on in expectancy.</p>

<p>"The fun will now begin," whispered Harry, and
it surely did. The club bearer returned with a troubled
look, and addressed the Chief.</p>

<p>The people soon learned of what had taken place,
and the commotion was evident. They speedily lost
all semblance of order, and began to run to and fro.
The scowl on the face of the Chief was terrible, nor
did he in the least attempt to conceal his anger.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_98" id="p_98" href="#p_98">p. 98</a></span></p>

<p>With a vehemence that caused the crowd to shiver,
he gave a command, and in a moment three men were
brought forward, almost in a state of collapse with
terror written in their countenances. They were the
unfortunate guards, as the boys quickly saw.</p>

<p>They were unable to answer the indictment of the
Chief, because the escape had been as much of a
surprise to them as to the Chief. Uraso and Muro
were quick to recognize the situation, and they informed
John of the progress of the conversation.</p>

<p>The negligent guards had been condemned to take
the places of the Korinos, as sacrifices. The rites
demanded some victims, and the boys now saw that
the escape of the Korinos would not avoid the carrying
out of the bloody rites.</p>

<p>The new, victims-to-be were firmly bound, and
placed in the center of the crowd, and, strangely
enough, it was now noticed that the people expressed
the same degree of hatred to the poor unfortunates
that they had manifested toward the Korinos an hour
before.</p>

<p>The Chief was now at the head of the procession,
which, instead of going to the north, passed alongside
the slight elevation that led north of the grove,
and toward the high elevation which the boys had
noticed the day before.</p>

<p>The march was but a short one, and when the
upper level was reached the boys were astounded to
see that beyond, and next to the hill, on the north,
was an open space, the floor of which was of solid
rock. This space covered nearly an acre, and near
the center was a flat rocky table, fully ten feet in<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_99" id="p_99" href="#p_99">p. 99</a></span>
diameter and about four feet high, with a huge boulder
in the center of the table.</p>

<p>The Chief and the victims marched directly to the
stone table, the executioner tramping with a measured
tread immediately ahead of the victims. The
people did not go near the rocky shelf, but circled
about at a respectful distance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>HYPNOTISM ON SAVAGES</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>All</span> those with the Chief's party, approached the
table, upon which the executioner mounted the rock,
and stood there, as though inviting the admiration
of the crowd.</p>

<p>John spoke a few words to Uraso, and the latter
addressed the Chief as follows: "The White Chief
says that to offer these men as a sacrifice will be
against the wishes of the Great Spirit, if they are
destroyed by the weapon which is now in the hands
of the one on the rock."</p>

<p>The Chief quickly turned. "What would the
White Chief have me do? I cannot free these culprits,
because it is the law that they shall die in
place of those who are appointed to be the victims."</p>

<p>"The White Chief does not ask for their lives,
but only that the manner of their death shall be
changed."</p>

<p>"That shall be done. What is the White Chief's
wish?"</p>

<p>"He will be the executioner."</p>

<p>The Chief threw his arms around Uraso's neck,
in raptures of joy, and turning to the man on the
table, ordered him to descend. John quietly conferred
with Uraso, and the latter mounted the table,
and the prisoners were led up until they faced him.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_101" id="p_101" href="#p_101">p. 101</a></span></p>

<p>Uraso, addressing them, said: "You have been
condemned by your Chief to die because you have
deceived his people and brought sorrow on all. The
Great White Chief has seen the misery you have
caused by allowing the Korinos to escape, and you
must now take their places as the victims to appease
the Great Spirit.</p>

<p>"The White Chief has asked to be permitted to
offer you up as sacrifices to his God, as well, and
the White Man's death is a terrible one. When you
die it will not cause you to go out of the world forgetting
all that you may suffer, but you will always
know and suffer through all time, and you will never
know a day that is free from misery.</p>

<p>"Your dying will be like a thousand deaths, and
your living hours will be like fire that always burns
and never consumes."</p>

<p>Thus Uraso went on, and as he spoke the poor
victims' eyes grew greater and greater, and the terror
more pronounced. He ceased for a moment and
John slowly walked to the table, and mounting it,
said quietly to Uraso: "Tell them that when I raise
my hands over my head the ends of their living
death will begin."</p>

<p>When this was imparted, the agony on their faces
was pitiful to see. John advanced, and spread out
his palms toward them, and quickly drew his hands
toward him, and this was repeated three times.</p>

<p>It is a curious thing that most savages believe
in the mysticism of some particular number. In
Africa some tribes, if they hear an animal cry four
times, will brave any danger, as it is a sign that the
bird has knowledge of safety to his person.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_102" id="p_102" href="#p_102">p. 102</a></span></p>

<p>Others watch with great care the repetition of an
insect's call, and particularly the number of times
an unusual noise occurs, and the belief is somewhat
analogous to the views which white people have
about the cricket. Milton, Byron, Southey, and
Dickens have written stories about them, so it is
not to be wondered at that the poor benighted savages
should have some belief about such things.</p>

<p>After the rites at the tree in the forest, it was
evident that three was the cryptic, or mysterious
number, and John used it on this occasion, for in
all the peculiar signs that he had previously employed,
three was the number that impressed itself
on the minds of the people, and it doubtless had its
effect on the condemned.</p>

<p>Slowly John moved from side to side, and he now
saw the intense expression, as their eyes followed
his every motion. His motions grew less and less
rapid; he moved toward them, and then suddenly
retreated, and through all these evolutions the three
men's faces became more and more tense, and finally
the muscles of their faces relaxed, their eyes stared
with a blank expression, and the motions of John almost
ceased.</p>

<p>The boys looked about them. They, too, had a
spell woven about them which they could not understand.
It was the most remarkable feeling they had
ever experienced. The multitude did not stir a
limb. The Chief was rigid, his face colorless, lips
parted, and eyes fixed at what he saw before him.</p>

<p>Suddenly, John sprang forward, and raised both
arms high above his head, and instantly the three
men fell back and lay rigid, full length on the rock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_103" id="p_103" href="#p_103">p. 103</a></span>
John turned, but while there were forms before him,
there was no sound. Hundreds of eyes gazed, but
they stared mutely.</p>

<p>"I feel awfully funny," said Harry.</p>

<p>"Do you know what John has been doing?" asked
George.</p>

<p>"I know; he has hypnotized the men!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and everybody else!"</p>

<p>When John turned, he waved his hand, the audience
relaxed its tension, and witnessed the death (?)
of the three men, an act performed by the White
Chief without having touched them. The Chief
slowly walked forward, and Uraso led him to the
platform, while John pointed to the mute victims.</p>

<p>John motioned to Uraso to raise the first man by
lifting his feet while he grasped the shoulders, and
when the body was lifted up it was perfectly rigid.
The same exhibition was performed with the two
others. That they were dead, was apparent to the
Chief and the people.</p>

<p>The people surged to and fro. John was a Korino
now, in the eyes of the people. When the people
pressed forward John spoke to Uraso, and he turned
to the people.</p>

<p>"The White Chief says that there will be no more
sacrifices, because the Great Spirit wills it otherwise.
The Korinos must be brought from the
caves&mdash;"</p>

<p>Uraso could get no further. The people were
aroused. Their voices could be heard uttering
threats against the witch doctors.</p>

<p>John saw that they were determined to wreak
vengeance upon them, but he counseled them to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_104" id="p_104" href="#p_104">p. 104</a></span>
wise and obey their Chief, and that the Korinos
would acknowledge their own error.</p>

<p>The wives and children of the three guards were
present, as they were compelled to be, and, as may
well be imagined, their grief was terrible to behold.</p>

<p>Uraso again spoke to the people, and said: "The
White Chief intends to show that the Great Spirit
does not wish sacrifices, and will give back the guards
to their families."</p>

<p>When he ceased speaking John stooped forward,
and waved his hands three times, the motion being
formed by throwing his hands forward, palms downward,
and then slowly raising them up, and with an
upward and an outward swing, bringing them down
again.</p>

<p>Then he advanced forward a few feet and held out
his arms horizontally, with the palms uppermost,
and speaking a few words, the arms were impressively
raised. As he did so the three men slightly
turned, and then almost simultaneously raised themselves
to a sitting posture, and glanced about wildly.</p>

<p>The consternation on the part of the natives at
this sight was beyond all description. They were
awe stricken, and dumbfounded. Not the slightest
sound could be heard, as the men arose to their
feet.</p>

<p>The only ones who were joyously affected were
the wives of the men who, at the words of Uraso,
sprang forward and were about to ascend the rock,
but at the command of John they leaped from the
table, and the children gathered about them.</p>

<p>The Chief did not utter a word of protest. He
remained there utterly speechless. When John<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_105" id="p_105" href="#p_105">p. 105</a></span>
asked him what was the next thing to be done to carry
out the rites, he remained standing for some time
without answering.</p>

<p>When he had gathered together his faculties he
turned to the people and said: "The Great White
Chief has shown his power, and proven to us that
our Korinos have lied to us. They must be destroyed.
Let the people return to the village, and
proceed with the feast. We shall be guided by the
White Chief."</p>

<p>This was, indeed, the effect that John wished to
produce, but he did not also anticipate that the Chief
would insist upon the destruction of the Korinos.</p>

<p>The feast that afternoon was a repetition on a
larger scale, of the feast of the day before. Indeed,
this was now the third day of feasting.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I can eat any more for a
few days," said Harry, as they neared the village,
and saw the preparations going on.</p>

<p>George laughed, as he responded: "We shall
have to go through with this thing, whatever the
cost. Have you forgotten that they believe in <i>three</i>
for everything? Didn't John make three passes to
kill them; and three more to bring them to life again?
We have had two feasts, and must now have one
more. I don't know what the result will be if I eat
half as much even, as I did yesterday."</p>

<p>John laughed heartily, as he added: "That is
correct, too, about the feasts. Notice from this time
on that about everything they do will be measured
by threes."</p>

<p>As the boys afterwards remarked, they never
knew how they got through the feast that day, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_106" id="p_106" href="#p_106">p. 106</a></span>
they tried to imitate John in partaking of the good
things in moderation.</p>

<p>It was late in the night when the natives ceased
the dancing, which was the signal for the end of the
festival, although in many respects it was entirely
different from the previous ceremonies, as Uraso
and Muro learned in talking with the natives.</p>

<p>The next day was ushered in with a rainstorm, the
first that was experienced on the island, and there
was no opportunity to make any excursions. It had
been John's intention to settle the fate of the Korinos,
as he felt that this was a matter that should
have his attention before they left on the further
explorations of the island.</p>

<p>Since it was impossible to venture out far from
the village, John spent the most of the day attending
to the wounded and the sick, although they had
not been neglected in the meantime, not even during
the ceremonies of the past three days.</p>

<p>The first visit was made to the quarters of the
white man who was found in the stockade when they
took possession of the village. It was evident from
the greeting that he and John had had several conversations
previous to this visit, but of this the latter
did not advise the boys.</p>

<p>When they came into the room he was sitting up,
and he greeted John and the boys. He could speak,
but it was with a weak voice, and the boys ranged
themselves on one side while John seated himself
on the other.</p>

<p>"You told me yesterday," began John, "that when
you were shipwrecked you were cast ashore on another
island. How many companions had you?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_107" id="p_107" href="#p_107">p. 107</a></span></p>

<p>"Three," he answered. "One of them was a large
man, with brown hair and piercing eyes, who was
formerly an officer in the navy, and was at that
time engaged in an exploring capacity, and on his
way to Australia."</p>

<p>"Did he walk with a limp?" asked John.</p>

<p>The old man, as well as the boys, looked at John
in surprise. He quickly answered: "Yes; did you
know him?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied; "but we found him less than a
month ago."</p>

<p>The old man leaned forward in his eagerness.
"Where is he?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He is dead," answered John, gravely.</p>

<p>"Dead!" he exclaimed. "Dead! and do you know
his name?"</p>

<p>"No, but we found his remains, together with the
boat to which he had been tied, on the shore of an
island south of this."</p>

<p>"Then it is true, after all!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Did you know about it?" asked John, who was
the interested one now.</p>

<p>"No, this is sad news to me. His name was Clifford,&mdash;Ralph
S. Clifford, and when he and Walter
undertook,&mdash;"</p>

<p>The boys were all impatience now, as George cried
out: "Walter! did you know Walter?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he was my companion for a time. He and
I were making explorations on the island on which
we were wrecked, and when the two undertook to go
on a search, to ascertain what the island was like, I
was too ill to go with them. Walter returned, and
told me of meeting with a band of savages on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_108" id="p_108" href="#p_108">p. 108</a></span>
western side of the mountain, and of the capture of
Clifford by the natives."</p>

<p>"Did you know a man by the name of Wright?"</p>

<p>"No, I never heard of any one by that name in
this section of the globe."</p>

<p>"Do you know what became of Walter?"</p>

<p>"I was about to say, that we went north along the
shore, and camped near the beach, and there found
a boat, rather crudely made, with which we proposed
sailing around the island. Before we could
complete our arrangements, Walter disappeared."</p>

<p>"Did he take the boat with him?"</p>

<p>"No; the boat and all his effects were still with
me. I was still very ill, and I concluded to remain
there until my strength returned, but four days
afterwards, when I was able to move about, I found
that the boat had disappeared."</p>

<p>The strain of the conversation appeared to affect
him, and the three visitors stated they would call
on him later for further information.</p>

<p>When the boys returned to their huts, with John,
the latter was quiet and very much reserved. The
boys were so much interested in the story of the
old man, that they could not wait until they were
seated before they began to question him.</p>

<p>"What do you think of his story?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>John did not answer promptly, as was his habit.
Instead, he reflected for some time, and at last said
slowly: "The story may be true. Clifford was, in
my opinion, tied to the boat and set adrift, and his
death was due to that, unquestionably."</p>

<p>"Do you think this man had anything to do with
it?" asked George.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_109" id="p_109" href="#p_109">p. 109</a></span></p>

<p>"So far, I have no direct reason for thinking so,
but there are several very curious things about the
story."</p>

<p>"What in particular do you have in mind?"</p>

<p>"He said the boat was found on the seashore, and
that Walter left without taking it with him, but that
when he recovered the boat was gone."</p>

<p>"Is it an unreasonable story?"</p>

<p>"That is not at all improbable. The tide might
have washed it away, but, if it was our boat, and
it was provided with the peculiar rope and the
strange oars, that were found in it when it was recovered
by you, it would be interesting to know
whether he or Walter put them there."</p>

<p>"Why is that so interesting to know?"</p>

<p>"Because the rope found in that boat, is the same
as the rope we took from Clifford's body, which
you discovered on Venture Island."</p>

<p>"If we could only find Walter now it would solve
that mystery," said Harry. "I don't like to think
that this man was instrumental in the Clifford tragedy."</p>

<p>"Nor do I," responded John. "It is evident there
is some connection between that boat and the skeleton,
and that our boat played a part in it." This
ended the conversation on this point.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that two of the men rescued
from the prison stockade, were natives of another
tribe, who had been captured some weeks before.
Upon inquiry John found that they had disappeared
the day before.</p>

<p>The two others, in a very emaciated condition,
were still under John's care, and rapidly improving.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_110" id="p_110" href="#p_110">p. 110</a></span>
No attempts had been made to question them, and
as it was the intention of the boys to commence the
trip to the north, as soon as John had settled the
matter with the Korinos, they were anxious to get
some information from them concerning their tribe.</p>

<p>Accompanying Uraso, and through him, they first
learned that the people they were now living with
were called Malosos, and that the Chief was named
Ta Babeda, which meant the <i>strong man</i>. He was
not so large as Beralsea, the Chief of Venture
Island, but his muscles were more active, thus the
boys could see that he rightly acquired the sceptre
of chief ruler, as did Beralsea, because of the
strength he possessed, and there was no one on the
island to question his king-ship.</p>

<p>While rambling about the boys and Uraso were
informed that John wished to see them at the Chief's
house, and they went over without delay. Entering
the house, they were surprised to see that the
different packages containing the presents had been
opened, and were about to be distributed.</p>

<p>The Chief and his household were first provided
for. The articles consisted of coats, and different
articles of wear for the Chief, together with a watch,
a revolver, and a camera.</p>

<p>"This will give both of you boys an opportunity
to give the Chief some lessons in these instruments,"
said John.</p>

<p>The articles for the women were received with
screams of delight that pleased the Chief beyond
measure. Bits of lace, the like of which had never
been seen on the island, cotton fabric, beads, articles
of ornamentation, and finally full-fledged dresses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_111" id="p_111" href="#p_111">p. 111</a></span>
were only parts of the gifts which went to the women
and children.</p>

<p>"With your permission," said John, to the Chief,
"I will offer gifts to your people, and you may state
that during the afternoon the articles will be arranged
in packages so that all will receive presents
of like value."</p>

<p>The boys, as well as Uraso and Muro, were busy
making up the gifts for distribution. During the
remaining portion of the day they were busily engaged
in this work, which brought the greatest joy
and happiness to the natives.</p>

<p>It may well be imagined that Uraso and Muro were
not slow in imparting the news of Wonder Island
to the natives. John had a long conference with the
Chief on the same subject.</p>

<p>"But how can we get these articles?" he asked,
as John told him how they made the wonderful
things.</p>

<p>"You can make them here," he answered.</p>

<p>"But we cannot make them if we do not have the
tools."</p>

<p>"Then you can buy them," responded John.</p>

<p>"But what have we that you want?" he asked, as
he eagerly scanned John's face.</p>

<p>"Your land is full of things that the people in
Wonder Island want, and the whole world will buy
them of you."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what they want and how we
shall get them ready for you?"</p>

<p>"It will give us pleasure to send our people over
who can tell you what spices, and nuts, and coffee,
and other things which you have in abundance, can<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_112" id="p_112" href="#p_112">p. 112</a></span>
be prepared, and what they are worth, and it will
be the means of giving the people work, and peace
and contentment."</p>

<p>"But if we do not have any more fighting with
our enemy there will be no need of a strong Chief,"
he remarked, thinking of his new relation to the
scheme as outlined.</p>

<p>"There will be a much greater need of a strong
man like you, who can mete out equal justice to the
people," remarked John.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE REMARKABLE CAVE EXPLORATIONS</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>But</span> the time was now at hand, when it became
necessary for the exploring expedition to the north.
The rescued prisoners stated that their people, while
not so numerous, were very warlike, and by degrees,
John learned that they were the cannibals of whom
they had heard.</p>

<p>The tribe was known as the Umbolos, and the
Chief was a frightful man, unlike any other in the
tribe, or, at any rate, from the description, he was
not formed like them. He was known as Rumisses,
which in their tongue meant <i>thunder</i>.</p>

<p>It was remarkable that Uraso and Muro understood
most of the words of the language used by the
natives here and also on Venture Island. On Wonder
Island, there were only two tongues, or dialects,
and the people on this island, as well as on
Venture Island, spoke the dialect belonging to the
Illyas, Kurabus and the Tuolos, the tribes that were
the fiercest and the most difficult to subdue.</p>

<p>It was hoped that the escape of the two Umbolos,
and the return to their people would be sufficient to
give them the entree to that part of the country,
but after the questionings of John on this point, it
was very doubtful whether this would impress itself
on their minds.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_114" id="p_114" href="#p_114">p. 114</a></span></p>

<p>The natives had been accustomed for so long a
period to regard every other people as an enemy,
and consequently absolutely removed from any possibility
of friendship, that it was questionable
whether the messengers could persuade the Chief to
receive them.</p>

<p>Arrangements for the departure were decided
upon, and they planned to start early in the morning.
John visited the Chief, and suggested that he
should consider it a favor if the Chief would permit
him to take the Korinos with him.</p>

<p>The Chief opened his eyes in astonishment.
"Why do you wish to be burdened with men who
will live by deceiving?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"But they have lived to the best of their knowledge.
They do not know any better. They believe
what they have been taught, and think it is a duty to
carry out and practice their rites. They do not wish
to deceive you."</p>

<p>The Chief pondered for a long time, and then replied:
"What will you do with them?"</p>

<p>"I want to teach them the white man's ways, and
tell them to come back and teach your children the
things which we believe are right and for the good
of the people."</p>

<p>The lessons which John imparted were sources of
wonder and amazement to the ruler, who, five days
before, thought he was the only one appointed to
make and to execute laws.</p>

<p>When he finally gave his consent, he said: "You
must take it upon yourself to get the Korinos, because
they will not come out of their caves."</p>

<p>"But how can they find food there? If you pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_115" id="p_115" href="#p_115">p. 115</a></span>vent
them from getting food they will be compelled
to come out or starve."</p>

<p>"They will starve before they will permit themselves
to be taken."</p>

<p>"Then," answered John, "why do you not order
your warriors to enter the cave and take them by
force?"</p>

<p>"But who dares to go in?"</p>

<p>"I dare to go in, but you must order me to do so,"
answered John.</p>

<p>The Chief jumped up in an instant. "And will
you go?" he asked in the greatest delight.</p>

<p>"By all means. You must go with me to the cave,
and there command me to enter and bring them
forth."</p>

<p>The Chief's eyes danced with delight, and he could
hardly await the hour for starting on the mission.</p>

<p>The boys and the two companion chiefs, were in
their glory upon hearing of the decision to get the
Korinos. Before leaving the Chief John questioned
him very closely on the location of the cave, and
whether there were not other caves on the island to
the north.</p>

<p>"I have heard that there is another one to the
north, that was used in olden times by the Korinos
who lived when my father was Chief. I also know
that far to the north where the false and treacherous
Umbolos live, are great caves which no man may
enter."</p>

<p>"Do they have Korinos in the Umbolo tribe?"</p>

<p>"No; they do not believe in a Great Spirit."</p>

<p>"Then, if they have no Korinos, why do they not
dare to enter the caverns?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_116" id="p_116" href="#p_116">p. 116</a></span></p>

<p>"Because they have been told that it is death to
go into the dark."</p>

<p>"Do you know why they think so?"</p>

<p>"Because, a long time ago, the only man who ever
returned from the dark caves, brought out the bones
of men who had died there."</p>

<p>"But it did not kill that man who brought them
out?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he died. And now no one dares enter those
places."</p>

<p>It may be imagined how this intelligence stirred
up the boys. It was impossible to keep them from
talking about it. To John it was like a magic wand;
it seemed to wave before his eyes and to talk to him.
What if they had really found the great cave on
which John's heart was so keenly bent?</p>

<p>But the Korinos must be freed. That afternoon,
just before starting, the boys were surprised to see
the band coming up the street. How they laughed,
as they scented John's little ruse. It would, indeed,
be a treat to bring the Korinos out of their dark resorts
to some good old marching tune.</p>

<p>The band struck up a familiar air, and to its lively
tones the procession, with the three Chiefs and John
at the head, marched across the open, and up the
hill past the grove, on its way to the cave on the
eastern slope of the high hill which rose from the
shore of the ocean.</p>

<p>There was jest and laughter, the Chief enjoying
the treat that would be the greatest pleasure of his
life, namely, the bringing of the Korinos out of the
cave.</p>

<p>After ascending the great hill, so that they over<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_117" id="p_117" href="#p_117">p. 117</a></span>looked
the ocean, the Chief informed John that the
entrance was a third of the way down the hill, and
the narrow path was followed which led around to
the north, shutting out the sight of the sea.</p>

<p>After a few hundred feet, the path led to a cleft
portion of the rocks, where the light of the sun
was completely hidden. The walls of the rocks, at
the entrance of the cleft portion, were fully fifty
feet high, and were at least twenty feet apart, but
as they went on the walls drew nearer together and
the path ascended a slight incline.</p>

<p>A sharp turn was reached, and they found themselves
in a little cove, to the left of which was a dark
entrance, toward which the Chief nodded, as he
shrank back.</p>

<p>John motioned to the Chief, and the latter sternly
commanded John to bring forth the Korinos. John
said a few words to Uraso and Muro, and also invited
the boys to accompany them.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are all armed?" said John.</p>

<p>The boys and the chiefs had come well prepared,
so this point was taken care of.</p>

<p>"But where are the lights?" asked George.</p>

<p>"I have them," said John, "but we shall not use
them now, for reasons which will be explained later."
Together they entered the cave, the darkness of
which was appalling. After going in fully a hundred
and fifty feet, John stopped and said: "It
would have been a sign of weakness to go in with
a light. When we have gone far enough to be free
from the mouth of the cave, we can use our flash
lights. For the present we shall move on to ascertain
whether the Korinos are provided with lights,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_118" id="p_118" href="#p_118">p. 118</a></span>
which will show where they are, and we may thus be
guided to them."</p>

<p>The distance traveled must have been fully a thousand
feet, when John again spoke: "I shall now
throw the light directly ahead, and you must keep
your eyes open to detect anything moving."</p>

<p>The light flashed, and was then moved slowly to
the left, until it reached a cove at the extreme eastern
side, where there was an evident assemblage of
articles, not a hundred feet in advance of them, but
there was not a sign of living beings within the scope
of the light beams.</p>

<p>The company moved over to the spot indicated. A
moment's examination satisfied them that it was
really the abode of the Korinos, but they had disappeared.</p>

<p>The debris, the half eaten portions of food, some
still warm, were sufficient to indicate that they had
fled, but where? Uraso, Muro and John, all three,
flashed their lights, and, after examining the walls
critically, Muro was the first to find the opening
from the chamber in which they were standing.</p>

<p>The outlet from the chamber was to the north,
and toward it the explorers ran hurriedly, and
passed along the contracted path, which soon turned
to the left. After following its many windings, and
scrambling over the broken and rocky floor, they saw
ahead a streak of daylight, which gladdened the
hearts of the boys.</p>

<p>"Ah! they have gone," exclaimed John, as he
emerged, and glanced across the ravine, and along
the walls which extended up from the shore of a
little stream below. "They have gone to the north,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_119" id="p_119" href="#p_119">p. 119</a></span>
and have, probably, tried to seek safety in the other
cave."</p>

<p>"How are we going to get back?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Do you think there will be any trouble in that?"
asked John.</p>

<p>"We shall have to go clear over the mountain for
that, I'm afraid."</p>

</div>

<p>"We are not far from the entrance," said John,
"and if we intend to catch up with the Korinos, we
must not delay for a moment."</p>

<p>The party made a hurried trip around the hill, and
the Chief was surprised to learn that there was another
entrance, or an outlet to the cave on the north<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_120" id="p_120" href="#p_120">p. 120</a></span>ern
side. None of his warriors was aware of this,
however.</p>

<p>John was now in a quandary. He was exceedingly
anxious to secure the Korinos, but at the same time
there was some things in the appearance of the cave
that he wished to investigate. This was confided to
Uraso and Muro, and the latter suggested that he
and Uraso would undertake to follow the fleeing
men, and return to the village, while John and the
boys made the desired investigation.</p>

<p>This was readily assented to, and they at once
made their way across the hill, while John informed
the Chief of the action which they had decided to
take. One of the principal men of the village, in
whom the Chief had confidence, and who knew the
location of the upper caves, accompanied Uraso and
Muro.</p>

<p>The Chief, and those with him returned to the
village, while John remained behind under the pretense
that he wished to stay at the cave entrance
until they returned from the pursuit after the Korinos.</p>

<p>The boys first secured the flash lights which the
two chiefs had brought, and when all had departed
the boys and John entered the cave and marched
directly to the location of their interior home.</p>

<p>Every part of the habitation was well investigated.
Almost every kind of tool and implement
was found here in profusion, but singularly, none
of them appeared to be used. Several flint lock
guns, all rusted, and with decayed stocks, were
among the articles discovered, but the Korinos had
not used them.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_121" id="p_121" href="#p_121">p. 121</a></span></p>

<p>The inevitable copper vessels, entirely unlike those
of modern manufacture, were the first things to
claim the attention of the boys, as they recalled similar
articles found in the caves thitherto investigated
by them.</p>

<p>"This begins to look as though we are to have
the same experience we had at the cave at the Cataract,"
said George. "These vessels, no doubt,
were brought here by the buccaneers, and I'll be
surprised if we don't find a few more of their belongings
somewhere in this place."</p>

<p>After all the recesses in this vicinity had been
investigated they scanned the side walls to the right,
carefully going into the little recesses which were
found all along the jagged sides.</p>

<p>A hundred feet south of the living part of the
cave they came, unexpectedly upon a large extension,
not noticed before in their pursuit of the Korinos.
The chamber extended in a southerly direction,
and narrowed at the extreme opposite end.</p>

<p>"This has the appearance of leading to another
outlet, which would take us to the southern side of
the hill. It would be remarkable, indeed, if such
should be the case," said John, as he eagerly pressed
forward, until they had passed four chambers.</p>

<p>The walls were coming closer and closer, until
there was now barely room for them to pass through,
but they went in unhesitatingly, John in the lead.
The passage was not straight, so that the light did
not aid much in looking ahead, but suddenly the
flash threw a beam ahead, which showed that they
were at the entrance of a chamber.</p>

<p>John stopped and directed the search light to all<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_122" id="p_122" href="#p_122">p. 122</a></span>
parts of the cavern. It appeared to be nearly round,
with a perfectly smooth floor. It was unoccupied,
but in the exact center of the chamber was a raised
object, like a mound.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire cave could be found the
calcareous deposit so common in caves formed in
limestone rocks, and the stalactite hangings on the
ceilings and walls, and the stalagmites on the floors
made the scene a weird one.</p>

<p>John glanced upwardly to view the ceiling, above
the mound, and said: "That does not seem to be
a natural formation. Let us examine it first."</p>

<p>With the small pick which John always carried,
and by means of which he was always careful to
examine rocks and geological formations, while on
these tours, the top parts of the stalagmites were
chipped off. This was an exceedingly simple matter,
since they are generally soft.</p>

<p>After the top layer was removed, the part beneath
readily yielded, but before they had an opportunity
to dig into it very deeply the pick struck
something which gave forth a metallic sound. John
stopped as though paralyzed.</p>

<p>The pick was again driven in. Again the plain
contact with some hard substance. The digging was
now feverish, and when the broken parts were
cleared away, a small metallic box, about twelve
inches square across the top, and about ten inches
deep, was exposed to view.</p>

<p>The dent made by the pick was clearly visible, and
the fresh mark showed that the metal was red.</p>

<p>"It is copper!" said John.</p>

<p>Every part of the material around the box was<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_123" id="p_123" href="#p_123">p. 123</a></span>
removed, and this enabled them to remove it from
its resting place. John grasped it and securing a
good hold, finally raised it.</p>

<p>"No, it is not any heavier than I thought it would
he," he remarked as he lay it down.</p>

<p>"Did you expect to find this?" asked George in
amazement.</p>

<p>"No; this is a surprise to me as it is to you."</p>

<p>"Then why did you make that remark?"</p>

<p>"Because I believe that this box contains treasure
of untold value. I should have been surprised if
it weighed very much."</p>

<p>"Could it not have contained treasure if it had
been heavy?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>John laughed, a peculiar exultant chuckle, as he
responded: "Not the kind of treasure I have had
in contemplation."</p>

<p>The box was turned over and over. There was
not the sign of any lid, or crack which showed the
cover or means of opening it. "We must take this
out and open it at our leisure," remarked John, "but
before doing so it would be well to examine the
other outlets to this chamber, if it has any."</p>

<p>The chamber was found, on measurement, to be
thirty feet in diameter, and the vaulted ceiling fully
thirty feet high, singularly uniform in the domed
formation, and not rough or jagged like the ceiling
of the other chamber which they had just left.</p>

<p>The walls were absolutely solid on all sides, the
only entrance being by way of the narrow little passageway
through which they had come. Harry
picked up the box, and swung it up to his shoulder,
and, John leading the way, they filed out and passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_124" id="p_124" href="#p_124">p. 124</a></span>
through the chamber, quickly making their way to
the opening through which they first entered the
cave.</p>

<p>Within an hour they were back in the village, and
found Muro there awaiting their arrival. "We
have found their trail, and they have not gone to
the upper cave. They are heading straight for the
tribe in the northern end of the island."</p>

<p>"I am surprised at that," said John. "We must
consult the Chief about this," and without another
word, he hurriedly went over to the Chief, who was
as much astounded as John could be at the peculiar
significance of their actions.</p>

<h3>THE TRIBE TO THE NORTH</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>Instead</span> of conveying the copper box to the village
it was carried to the landing place and taken
to the vessel, where it could be examined later, when
they had more time. It was now of more importance
to keep in touch with Muro and Uraso, the
former of whom had gone to the north as soon as
he had given the report mentioned in the last chapter.</p>

<p>On the return to the village they discussed the
affairs of the previous day, which John had abstained
from mentioning.</p>

<p>"What is it that really makes the people act that
way when they are hypnotized!" asked George. "I
have heard it said that there isn't any truth in mesmerism."</p>

<p>"Mesmerism is the old term used to designate certain
phenomena, which, originally, was supposed to
be a force that emanated from the mesmerist. It
is now known that hypnotism may be regarded as
artificial catalepsy."</p>

<p>"But what is catalepsy?"</p>

<p>"It is an affection produced by hysteria, during
which the patient's body becomes rigid. It is
claimed by some that somnambulism is one phase of
the hypnotic condition."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_126" id="p_126" href="#p_126">p. 126</a></span></p>

<p>"But in what way do your motions act on the one
who is being hypnotized?"</p>

<p>"The motions have nothing whatever to do with
producing the condition. That is for effect, merely.
Those who are able to bring about a mesmeric condition,
try to concentrate the mind on some particular
thing, and by making gentle motions, or
passes, this is more forcibly impressed on them."</p>

<p>"What was the object of Uraso telling them that
the White Man's death was a terrible one, and trying
to frighten them?"</p>

<p>"Merely to make them concentrate their minds on
one thing alone. Terror, or great fear, is one of
the things which tends to a cataleptic condition.
Great excitement, and sometimes excessive joy, have
been known to do the same thing."</p>

<p>"Then the object is merely to bring the mind under
the control of the operator?"</p>

<p>"Yes; what was originally considered as a power
flowing from the hypnotist, is nothing more than his
mental action or control which prevents the subject
from exercising his own volition."</p>

<p>A few hours after they returned to the village
Uraso and Muro returned, with the information that
the Korinos were now within the territory of the
tribe to the north, and they wisely concluded it would
not be good policy to pursue them further, and their
prudence was commended by John.</p>

<p>The natives were supremely happy in displaying
their gifts, and the Chief, while much annoyed at
the escape of the Korinos, was content to be relieved
of their presence, when, after numerous conversa<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_127" id="p_127" href="#p_127">p. 127</a></span>tions
with John, he realized that they were of no use
to him and his people.</p>

<p>John announced that he intended to visit the tribe
to the north, and purposed starting the following
day. The Chief advised him to take with him all
the warriors in the village, because he felt sure they
would have a hostile reception.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," replied John, "that would be
the wrong thing to do. I do not wish him to think
that my mission is a warlike one, and a large force
will be in the nature of an invasion of his territory."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right; but we have found him
a difficult Chief to deal with. He is not like a man.
He cannot stand up straight, as we do, and he kills
and eats all who fall into his hands."</p>

<p>This information was regarded by John as one of
the imagination, purely, so it did not weigh heavily on
his mind. What seemed to impress him most was
the fate of the poor fellows who had voluntarily
sought the protection of the cannibal Chief.</p>

<p>"I would like to have your opinion as to the course
which the Chief will take when the Korinos fall into
his hands?" asked John.</p>

<p>The Chief mused for a while, and then said:
"They have no Korinos and do not believe in them,
but they may tell the Chief that we tried to offer
them as sacrifices, and he may use them with his
people to stir up feelings of revenge against us."</p>

<p>"But," replied John, "the captives you took, and
who have escaped may tell him of our treatment of
them and this may work in our favor."</p>

<p>"I do not think so," he replied. "We have had<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_128" id="p_128" href="#p_128">p. 128</a></span>
many instances where they have refused to make
friends with us, and for that reason we always had
war."</p>

<p>"But have you not often sacrificed their people
when you have taken them in your wars?"</p>

<p>"We have always done so."</p>

<p>"Have any of your captives ever returned to
them?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And have they always killed and eaten your people
when they captured them?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and none has ever returned to us. The
Korinos would not let us keep the captives, but said
that the Great Spirit told them they must be sacrificed."</p>

<p>The foregoing information was sufficient to convince
John of one thing, namely, that it was really
the spirit of the Korinos which kept up the tribal
warfare, at least so far as one end of the conflict was
concerned.</p>

<p>In spite of all the arguments advanced by the
Chief, John was determined to make the trip with
his own people, and thus avoid any feeling on the
part of the tribe, against their present friend.</p>

<p>In the morning John called Stut, and advised him
to wait until the following day, when he should pull
up anchor and proceed to the north for a distance
not exceeding twenty miles, and then, seeking a safe
anchorage, to await news from him.</p>

<p>With forty of his own trusted men, together with
Uraso and Muro, they set out on the march to the
north, cheered by the people of the village, who
came out to witness their departure. The old man<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_129" id="p_129" href="#p_129">p. 129</a></span>
who had been rescued, was still too weak to accompany
them, so he was taken to the vessel, where he
could receive the best of care and attention.</p>

<p>In order not to be out of touch with the sea, John
decided to follow the hills along the eastern side of
the island, and this course was selected because the
people to which they were going, unlike those at the
southern portion of the island, lived in the mountainous
region, as heretofore stated, and the probability
of meeting them would be much better than if
they had followed the level plateau.</p>

</div>

<p>In the march the boys, as well as John, were ever
on the alert to discover the possibilities of the island,
so far as the natural products were concerned.</p>

<p>"Something smells awfully sweet around here,"
said George, as they were tramping along a beautifully-wooded
crest.</p>

<p>"I think it must come from the trees that have the
beautiful pale blue flowers. Wait until I get a
branch."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_130" id="p_130" href="#p_130">p. 130</a></span></p>

<p>One of the men was quick to carry out Harry's
wish. John was immensely pleased at the interest
which the boys exhibited. "What does it smell like?"
he inquired.</p>

<p>"Something like cloves and cinnamon, both," answered
George.</p>

<p>"Peel off the bark and taste it."</p>

<p>"It is just like cinnamon."</p>

<p>"That is correct. It is the real cinnamon tree.
It is the cassia of the Bible, one of the spices so frequently
referred to in Scripture. The bark only is
used, but the species which have fruit, are gathered
and oil expressed from them, which is called <i>cinnamon
suet</i>."</p>

<p>Advancing, the surface became more rugged.
They had to cross numerous gullies, and broken portions,
and frequently jagged rocks would show themselves.
Evidently when the island was raised up
from the sea the rocks were forced through, and the
climate in time disintegrated them, and formed a soil.</p>

<p>"Do you think we shall find any minerals here?"
asked Harry.</p>

<p>"If we are to judge from our experiences on Wonder
Island, where there is almost exactly the same
formation, we may reasonably expect to find copper
and also iron here."</p>

<p>"While Harry and I were over at the bluff with
Uraso, we saw something like green drippings, from
the walls."</p>

<p>"That is, undoubtedly, copper,&mdash;that is the sulphate
form, in which it is usually found."</p>

<p>"I was amused at Laleo (the native guide), who
told Uraso this morning that our mission would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_131" id="p_131" href="#p_131">p. 131</a></span>
successful, and when he was asked why, answered,
that the first thing they saw was three black birds.
How superstitious these people are."</p>

<p>"Do you think they are any more so than civilized
people?" answered John. "It is curious how the
number three runs through all their ideas. In certain
parts of England they have a great many omens,
and one of them is that if the traveler, starting on a
journey, meets three magpies, it means success; if
two appears, it is a sign of marriage; and four unexpected
good news."</p>

<p>"I recall that it is considered lucky for sun to
shine on a bride," added Harry.</p>

<p>"The other part of that couplet is 'rain on a
corpse,'" remarked John.</p>

<p>"I never knew it was lucky for the corpse to be
rained on," responded Harry, in a questioning tone.</p>

<p>John laughed immoderately, as he answered:
"Well, it might not be lucky for the corpse. But
there are numerous lucky and unlucky signs that no
one can account for, prevalent in our own country,
such as putting on stockings wrong side out, and
finding a horseshoe."</p>

<p>"Of course, they are both fortunate signs," said
George, smiling at the thought.</p>

<p>"In Scotland, among those who are the most matter
of fact people in the world, signs are very common.
It is a bad omen with them to stumble over a
threshold, or to step over green or red, or to sneeze
while making up a bed."</p>

<p>"After all, we are not so much ahead of the savages,
are we?" mused George.</p>

<p>During the march that day there was nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_132" id="p_132" href="#p_132">p. 132</a></span>
specially worthy of note. The animals they met
were few and small, and it did not appear that there
were any which merited mentioning, so the boys
gave up the idea of meeting any adventure in that
line.</p>

<p>Shortly after four in the afternoon they began
to seek out some good camping place. Laleo informed
Uraso that they had now passed into the territory
claimed by the northern tribe, and the desirability
of caution was necessary.</p>

<p>A rocky shelter, only a short distance above a running
brook below, was found suitable, and there the
halt was made for the night. Early in the morning
they were awakened by Muro, with the welcome intelligence
that the <i>Pioneer</i> was sighted several miles
to the north, where she lay at anchor.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of John the boys went to the
headland, a mile to the east, and there hoisted a signal
flag, which was observed by the vessel, and the
return signal given, this being indicated by four
circular sweeps of the flag.</p>

<p>Waving the flag twice to the right, and twice to
the left indicated that they were to remain there until
further advised.</p>

<p>After a good breakfast the march was resumed,
leading further to the west to avoid the rugged hills
near the sea. Either Uraso or Muro was constantly
in the lead, always accompanied by one of the men
who, in case of necessity, might be sent back to furnish
John the reports of his observations.</p>

<p>Before noon the messenger came in with the welcome
information that the first of the natives had
been noticed, not far to the north. Muro, who was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_133" id="p_133" href="#p_133">p. 133</a></span>
the lead, awaited the arrival of John and the boys.</p>

<p>Together they went forward, the men remaining
in the camp. A few men could thus move through
the brush with less likelihood of observation, than a
large number, which was the principal reason for
this mode of procedure.</p>

<p>After another mile of cautious movement, a runner
was sent back with the order to bring all of them
forward. Away in the distance the village was
sighted, George's field glasses now being brought
into play. The huts could be seen plainly along
the mountain side, and scattered about in profusion
amid a plentiful supply of trees.</p>

<p>In some respects, viewed from a distance, the
scene did not look at all primitive, and were it not
for the crude character of the houses it might have
been taken for a typical modern town or village.</p>

<p>Only one hut had been passed, thus far. It was
not at all crudely built, and while it had been left to
decay, it showed that the owner had some ideas of
comfort, and an eye to convenience, as it was located
by the side of a spring. On one side of the cottage
was a weed-grown garden, and some fine specimens
of taro as well as wild potatoes were in evidence.</p>

<p>Earthenware cooking utensils were discovered,
which added to the interest of the place, but no other
furniture was found to show how the people lived.
It might have been deserted for a year or more.</p>

<p>Ascending the second small hill, they were startled
to find themselves face to face with a half dozen
of the natives, who were frightfully alarmed at the
appearance of the visitors, for they set up a shout
and ran like deer toward the village.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_134" id="p_134" href="#p_134">p. 134</a></span></p>

<p>John kept on at the head of his force, and while
the commotion in the village, not a half mile distant,
was plainly visible, he did not halt, until he saw a
curious crowd surrounding a short individual, who
stood apart from those around him.</p>

<p>"That is the Chief," said Laleo. "It is said he
is a terrible man, and unlike all others," thus repeating
what the Chief had told John.</p>

<p>As he made no attempt to come forward or indicate
what his wishes were, John directed the men
to follow him, fifty feet in his rear, and he went
on until within two hundred feet of the motley crowd,
the people in the meantime making no sign of resistance,
nor did they object to the advance.</p>

<p>When John stopped, the curious figure, who was
designated as the Chief, moved forward toward John
without a bit of hesitation, and the boys were simply
dumbfounded at his singular appearance, and at the
gait he assumed.</p>

<p>A word picture of him would not be amiss. He
was a hunchback, with an extraordinary lump on his
back, the arms much too long for his body, and
crooked, distorted legs. The head, however, was
massive, and covered with a heavy beard, which
seemed to grow close up to the eyes, giving him a
fierce appearance, because his head was covered with
a thick coating of long gray, or sandy hair, that
swung around the darker beard, as he shambled
along.</p>

<p>As he neared John his bright and staring eyes
were the first thing noticed. When he came across
the intervening space, his face was stern, and un<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_135" id="p_135" href="#p_135">p. 135</a></span>forbidding,
but as he neared John it relaxed, and
he began to smile.</p>

<p>John stepped forward, and extended his hand. "I
am glad to meet you," said John.</p>

<p>The man looked at John for a moment, and then
tried to mumble something, that the boys could not
understand. After a few attempts he fairly shrieked
out: "How are you?"</p>

<p>This was certainly a startling thing, because the
voice and the intonation were perfect. John opened
his jacket and brought out a miniature American
flag, which was unrolled, and the moment the strange
being caught sight of it he seized it and pressing it to
his lips, kissed it fervently.</p>

<p>"I am an American," he finally struggled to utter.
"I am a white man, and you are the first white man
I have seen for fifty years. You are welcome to our
home and village."</p>

<p>The boys could not credit their senses. How did
this poor specimen of the white race become the
powerful Chief of a tribe of savage cannibals?</p>

<p>John looked at him for a moment in astonishment,
as he asked: "How long have you been Chief of the
people here?"</p>

<p>"About forty-five years. They are good people
too."</p>

<p>"We heard you were cannibals," remarked John.</p>

<p>For a moment he scowled, and then his face brightened
up. "Yes; I know my neighbors to the south
have always believed that to be so, but they have
heard such tales from their witch doctors, such as we
used to have, but it is not true."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_136" id="p_136" href="#p_136">p. 136</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean the Korinos?"</p>

<p>"Yes, those who left you two days ago, and have
come to me for protection," and he smiled as he said
this.</p>

<p>"I tried to get them, but they eluded us," added
John, by way of information.</p>

<p>"You must pardon me, but it is still a little difficult
for me to form sentences. It is so long since I
have talked to any one in my native tongue. But
I am impolite. Bring your people into the village,
and let us entertain you. I do so want to hear about
the great world and what it is now like."</p>

<p>The Chief turned to his people and told them that
the White Chief was from his own tribe, and that he
came from a far-away country, on a visit to him, and
that they must treat the people as his own.</p>

<p>Nothing more was needed to make them welcome.
George suggested to John that Stut on the <i>Pioneer</i>
should be notified, but before they had time to carry
out the order a number of the villagers came rushing
through the village and sought out the Chief.</p>

<p>The latter turned to John and said: "My people
tell me that there is a large ship here."</p>

<p>"It is the vessel we came in," answered John,
"and we were about to send a messenger to tell them
to anchor near the village."</p>

<p>"I am so happy to know this," said the Chief. "I
want to see the ship, because it is the first time that
any one has stopped at our shores. Some years ago
we found some strange things that floated ashore
from a wrecked vessel, and I want to show them to
you, because I cannot understand what some of the
things could be used for."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_137" id="p_137" href="#p_137">p. 137</a></span></p>

<p>They were led through the principal street of the
town. It was clean and well kept; the huts were far
better than those in the village they had left, and the
natives were, apparently, happy and contented.</p>

<p>As they marched along George was the first to notice
a tall individual, who, with several others, were
edging away from the visitors.</p>

<p>"There they are!" he cried out. John turned to
inquire, when Harry commenced laughing, as he
added: "Here are the Korinos, John!"</p>

<p>The latter looked in the direction indicated, and
laughed when he saw their discomfiture. The Chief
was hurriedly informed of the situation, and he
laughed heartily, as he ordered one of his men to
bring in the fugitives.</p>

<p>They were ushered in, and Uraso told them that
they were friends and not enemies, and that the
White Chief tried to secure them so that their own
Chief would not harm them. It was a great relief,
unquestionably, and their actions showed it. John
then told them, that he wanted to have a talk with
them, and that he would assure them of their safety.</p>

<h3>THE HUNCHBACK CHIEF</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>The</span> White Chief's house was built on a plan
which was a vast improvement over anything found
on the two islands. True, it was nothing but an assemblage
of rooms, which surrounded an open court.
The furnishings were crude, but it was evident that
all the articles were such as had been taken from
the wreckages on the shore.</p>

<p>Goods not native made, were noticed, and even a
photograph, on a tin plate, like the old style daguerreotypes,
was observed by Harry. Three chairs, one
with a broken rocker, formed part of the furnishings
in the court. In one corner was a mass of articles,
the case of a ship's chronometer, the horn of a phonograph,
some tin tubes of different lengths, and other
odds and ends, which could not be recognized.</p>

<p>"I am anxious to hear your story," said John.
"If you have no objection we should be glad to have
you relate it."</p>

<p>"It will give me pleasure to tell of my experiences,
although it may not interest you; but before doing
so you must partake of food, because I know what
it means to travel through our country. Besides I
have ordered it prepared, and it is now ready."</p>

<p style="text-align: right; font-size: small;">[<a href="#p_122">See p. 122</a>]</p>
</div>

<p>"These two men I have with me," said John,
pointing to Uraso and Muro, "are Chiefs of two<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_139" id="p_139" href="#p_139">p. 139</a></span>
powerful tribes, who live on a neighboring island,
and they are real friends I found there when these
two boys and I were shipwrecked there several years
ago."</p>

<p>"I am, indeed, glad to welcome them. I see that
they have adopted the white man's clothing."</p>

<p>"Yes; and their people who are wonderfully interesting
are engaged in farming, and manufacturing."</p>

<p>Then John told him briefly the history of their
experiences, and how the people on Wonder Island
were working out their salvation.</p>

<p>John's tale impressed him most forcefully. "You
have made good use of your talents. Unfortunately,
for me, and for the natives here, I was not able
wholly to bring out the people from their low condition,
as you will be able to understand more fully
when the story is told." He said this sorrowfully,
and with apparent regret.</p>

<p>After the meal, he continued his narrative: "I
was a poor boy, a native of the State of Massachusetts,
and was bound to a whaler as a helper, when
less than fifteen years of age. It was a hard life,
as you may know. I had no education, and I learned
the life of misery and sorrow when I should have
been at school.</p>

<p>"But during that and the second year I became
hardened, and my unfortunate physical condition
made me the butt of my companions, and one day,
in a fit of resentment, I struck down one of my
tormentors, while in the harbor of Bedford, after
which I escaped and made my way to Boston.</p>

<p>"There, the next day, I found employment on an<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_140" id="p_140" href="#p_140">p. 140</a></span>
outgoing ship, that was in the China service, and two
days later, I was gratified to learn that it would sail
that night. I had a much easier berth, and now I
found that among those men I was considered better
than a mere brute, and I became acquainted with
a young man who taught me to read.</p>

<p>"This was such a delight to me that I could hardly
wait until my daily duties were over, before the
books were brought out, and by the time we put into
Shanghai, I could read and write, as well as perform
many examples in arithmetic.</p>

<p>"I knew nothing of geography, or of any other of
the necessary parts of education. Our outward trip
was unexciting, but on the first return trip, we met
one of the dangerous monsoons, and the ship was
wrecked. One of my shipmates was the sole occupant
of a spar, and he aided me in my attempt to
grasp it, and together we floated about the great sea
for several days, without a thing to eat or to drink,
until I lost consciousness, and knew no more until I
opened my eyes, and saw the vilest looking savages
standing about me.</p>

<p>"When I saw them they appeared like a horrid
dream. I had read in one of the books about the
terrible visions that men dream of, and when they
tried to make me eat something, I began to feel that
it was a reality.</p>

<p>"But the men were naked, and I saw the bones
of human beings about me, and everything had the
appearance of a feast. I soon saw that they were
cannibals, and as I had heard of their practices their
faces grew more and more repulsive to me.</p>

<p>"I recovered slowly, and now began the terror in<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_141" id="p_141" href="#p_141">p. 141</a></span>
my mind. Each day I expected would be my last.
But day after day passed by, and I soon began to
become reconciled to my fate. An incident soon
changed the entire aspect of affairs for me. I had
been treated with the utmost deference. I was furnished
with an abundance of food, but I had previously
learned that it was the custom of those people
to fatten their victims, and this was not welcome
knowledge.</p>

<p>"I became desperate. One day, while they were
bringing me the finest roasts, I rebelled, and taking a
club, scattered the food, swinging the club at them
and shouting defiance, because human nature began
to rebel, and I could not stand the suspense any
longer.</p>

<p>"To my surprise they scattered, and fell on their
faces. Among them was the head man, whom I had
always regarded as the Chief. Finally he came up
timidly, and fell on his knees before me. I was so
astounded that I did not know what to do. I went to
the Chief and raised him up, because I was in a
quandary, and could not understand them.</p>

<p>"This seemed to reassure him, and he told me to
follow him. I had been here long enough to understand
most of their jargon. I was surprised when
he led me to his own hut, and brought out his daughter,
who knelt before me. Then I began to understand.
I was no longer the expected victim, but the
prospective son-in-law. This was better than anticipating
death daily.</p>

<p>"I accepted the situation. The daughter became
my wife. It was she who welcomed you when we
came in. When her father died I became Chief, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_142" id="p_142" href="#p_142">p. 142</a></span>
long before his death, I controlled the people, as I
knew so much more, and had superior wisdom,
judged by their standard, that they obeyed me in
everything.</p>

<p>"But much as I abhorred, and tried to prevent it,
as I did on many occasions, they practiced their rites,
and had their Korinos, the real offenders, who taught
them the necessity of sacrifices.</p>

<p>"But when I became Chief, I sternly refused to
permit them to kill their captives, and cannibalism
was practiced only by stealth. I succeeded in stamping
out the practice only by putting the Korinos to
death, and in shutting up their caves."</p>

<p>The boys, as well as John were riveted to their
seats during this entire recital, until he referred to
the caves, when they relaxed, and indicated their
pleasure and anxiety. That meant still further
quests in that direction.</p>

<p>The Chief noticed their movement, and continued:
"I am tiring you, but permit me to add only a few
things. I have endeavored to better the condition
of these people, and have succeeded. To the south
of us was a powerful tribe. My first care was to
make ourselves secure against them.</p>

<p>"Like my people they, too, were cannibals. They
were ruled over by a Chief who was cruel, and whenever
any of their people escaped I took them in and
cared for them, and there are now many of those
living with us who could not be induced to go back.
For more than forty years no one has been killed
and eaten by my people."</p>

<p>"Your work here is certainly most commendable.
There is nothing which needs apology. Under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_143" id="p_143" href="#p_143">p. 143</a></span>
circumstances you have done all that was possible,
and to the best of your ability. No one can do
more," was John's timely observation.</p>

<p>"I thank you for the compliment. I owe everything
to the few books which my comrade taught me
to read. When I left the United States my heart was
bitter toward all mankind. I could not see why I
should have been treated in such a harsh manner
among civilized people, but when I landed here and
saw how much worse the conditions were, I began
to reflect. It would have been an easy and a natural
thing for me to be brutal to others, as they had been
to me."</p>

<p>"You have shown a noble spirit, and I shall try
to help you in caring for your people. Our ship is
here, and we have some things for you, as soon as
they can be unloaded," rejoined John.</p>

<p>During the afternoon communication was established
with the <i>Pioneer</i>, and the natives were willing
helpers in bringing up the packages, but it was too
late to distribute them. Before leaving John said:
"You have not told us your name."</p>

<p>"I was christened Ephraim Wilmar."</p>

<p>John seized him by the hands, as he said: "And
was your father's name William?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ephraim, as his great eyes grew still
bigger. "Did you know him?"</p>

<p>"I knew him well; he died about thirty years ago.
He was my father's friend."</p>

<p>This information established a bond of friendship
between the two.</p>

<p>"I have forgotten to take note of time, and I may
be out a year or two in my reckoning," continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_144" id="p_144" href="#p_144">p. 144</a></span>
Ephraim, "but according to the best information I
have this must be the year 1911."</p>

<p>"You are short one year; it is now 1912."</p>

<p>"Then let me see! We sailed from China in
January, 1860; and during that same month the ship
went down. From that time to the present I have
no idea of what has taken place."</p>

<p>"Then you know nothing of the four years' war
between the North and the South?"</p>

<p>"No; I remember there was some trouble about
the slaves, or something of that sort before we left
China."</p>

<p>"But there are no more slaves in the United
States."</p>

<p>"You surprise me! Then they were freed by the
war?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and Cuba is also free, and is now a republic,
and the Hawaiian Islands belong to the United
States, as also do the Philippines."</p>

<p>"That does not seem possible. Why, if I remember
correctly Cuba and the Philippines belonged to
Spain. When did the United States purchase
them?"</p>

<p>"We had a war with Spain, and we took the Spanish
possessions, as well as Porto Rico. Manila was
captured three days after war was declared."</p>

<p>"Three days after war was declared! How could
our fleet, which must have been half the way around
the world, get the news that war had been declared
in that time?"</p>

<p>"The commander of our fleet at Hongkong, was
notified by telegraph."</p>

<p>"How could that be done without a telegraph line?<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_145" id="p_145" href="#p_145">p. 145</a></span>
Over what part of the earth are the lines now running?"</p>

<p>"Everywhere; but there are many running under
the sea and are called <i>cable lines</i>."</p>

<p>Ephraim looked at John for a moment, as though
he doubted the meaning of the words just uttered,
and then slowly inquired: "That must be a remarkable
thing. I do not see how it would be possible to
string wires under the sea."</p>

<p>"They are encased in water tight coverings, and
some of the lines are four thousand miles long. But
nowadays we do not need wires for telegraphing."</p>

<p>The deformed figure arose, and appeared to be
agitated, as he said: "Do you mean to say that
messages can be sent without wires?"</p>

<p>"Stations for that purpose are now in operation
all over the world."</p>

<p>"That is as improbable to me as though you should
tell me that it would be possible to talk over a wire,"
he answered.</p>

<p>"But we do talk over wires, and it is possible to
talk over distances hundreds of miles apart, without
wires even."</p>

<p>He glanced at those about him, and shook his head.
He appeared to hesitate about asking any more questions,
and after shambling back and forth a dozen
times, or more, he stopped at the pile of debris, and
picked up a thick disk-like piece of metal, to one side
of which was a short broken tube attached.</p>

<p>"I have examined this many, many times. Perhaps
you can tell me what it is?" and he handed it
to John.</p>

<p>"This is the disk of a phonograph."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_146" id="p_146" href="#p_146">p. 146</a></span></p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"An instrument which will reproduce the human
voice, or any noise, or the sound of music."</p>

<p>"I do not understand what you mean. If I talk
to it will it talk back to me?"</p>

<p>"No; it is so arranged that one form of the instrument
receives the sound of your voice, and impresses
it on material in the form of a cylinder, or a
disk, and if this cylinder or disk is put into another
instrument, this little apparatus, which I hold in my
hand will speak the same words you uttered."</p>

<p>"Then electricity must be a wonderful thing, to be
able to be used by men to talk to each other all over
the world, and even to preserve what they say."</p>

<p>"But the phonograph is not an electrical apparatus.
The disk, here, with the little stylus, or pointer
on it, vibrates and gives forth the sound."</p>

<p>"All this is most marvelous, and I would like to see
some of those wonderful things," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"If you will come to the ship we will show you
many of the things that electricity does, as we have
a phonograph there, and we have a search light that<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_147" id="p_147" href="#p_147">p. 147</a></span>
operates by electricity, and which enables us to see
many miles," added Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes; I must see your ship, and I am ready to accompany
you any time, and I want my people to see
those things, as well."</p>

<p>"But there are many other things that we now do
with electricity. All street railways are now operated
by it; many boats are run by that power; cooking
is done by it, and its uses extend into almost
everything that man touches," remarked John.</p>

<p>"If this one branch of knowledge has improved so
wonderfully within a space of fifty years, the progress
in other directions must be very wonderful,
indeed," he responded. "But you have told me so
much, and I hardly know how I can grasp its meaning.
I suppose things here in this part of the world
must appear very crude to you?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE CHIEF'S FAMILY</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>Ephraim's</span> wife was not crude and uncouth, like
most of the native women. It was evident from the
care which she observed in the domestic arrangements,
that Ephraim had a hand in shaping her
course.</p>

<p>The food was served with considerable care, and,
in some degree with the formality observed in civilized
homes. John was a careful observer of customs,
and he was surprised to note that all the natives
patterned after the habits established by their
Chief.</p>

<p>"I tried," said Ephraim, in answer to John's
questions, "to better their condition, and to teach
them how to prepare and eat their food, and we
made vessels of pottery, which you will notice are
found everywhere. They understood the art of
weaving, in a very primitive way, which I also tried
to improve. Only on three occasions did we take
any toll from the sea, when the wreckage came
ashore.</p>

<p>"Of the articles which were thus recovered, I
took only a fair share, and the others were impartially
distributed to the people."</p>

<p>"Did you ever have any trouble with the natives,
or did they ever dispute your authority?" asked
John.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_149" id="p_149" href="#p_149">p. 149</a></span></p>

<p>"Only once, many years ago. A man claiming to
be the son of the Chief, gathered together a number
of adherents, but my people rose against them, and
killed the leaders, which I very much regretted.
When I remonstrated with them for the severity of
their course, they justified it by saying that I had
been kind to them, and had made them better, and
it was the very thing that taught me to feel that
human beings, although savages, understand kind
treatment. It made me a convert in my feelings
against some of the white men who had treated me
with such severity."</p>

<p>During the day, after the packages had been removed
from the ship the articles were taken from the
packages and arranged in Ephraim's home. Articles
of clothing were distributed to the Chief's family,
and what pleased him more than anything else,
were the cooking utensils, all of the newest ware,
and in great variety, some of which were curiosities
to him.</p>

<p>He had four children, the eldest a young man about
thirty years of age, who had a family of three children;
the next, a strong, active native, about twenty-five;
a medium-sized young woman, almost white, of
about twenty, and the youngest a lad of seventeen,
who was quickly attracted to the boys.</p>

<p>These, together with their mother, undertook the
task of distributing the gifts to the people. Articles
of adornment were, of course, the most enticing to
the natives, and John had anticipated this feeling
in the selection of the gifts.</p>

<p>After the feast of the good things, John broached
the subject next to his heart, and that was to explore<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_150" id="p_150" href="#p_150">p. 150</a></span>
the island, and particularly the caves. In referring
to the matter he said:</p>

<p>"I recognize that whatever treasure we may find
in them belongs to you, and you are entitled to
them."</p>

<p>"But they are of no use to us," he responded. "I
am not wise in the ways of the world, but I am sure
that great wealth, in the way of gold and silver,
would not make my people happy. I agree with you
that employment, and trying to teach people to help
and care for each other, is much more likely to make
them happy, and besides, the treasures which you
refer to could not be used by them to any advantage."</p>

<p>"You have spoken wisely," answered John,
"nevertheless, we have no need of the riches which
we may find. My search is for a different sort of
wealth."</p>

<p>"I do not understand what could be of more advantage,
or repay you better than gold and silver."</p>

<p>"It is believed that many of these places contain
the records of people who have lived here thousands
of years ago. All over the world hidden treasures
of that kind have been found, some of them which
go to show that men lived on the earth hundreds
of thousands of years."</p>

<p>"You are much wiser than I am, and understand
the reason for making such a search, but I do not see
why that would be of any use to know those things."</p>

<p>"A great man once said, 'Know thyself,' and another
remarked, that the 'proper study of mankind
is man.' To ascertain the origin of humanity, how
man lived and acted, what were his motives and desires,
his beliefs and his aspirations, and to know<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_151" id="p_151" href="#p_151">p. 151</a></span>
how he has improved, are interesting questions to
me."</p>

<p>He mused at this statement for a long time, and
then quietly said: "That may be so; it may make
us greater and better men, and it may be gratifying
to have that knowledge, but I have now arrived at
that time of life where things appear differently from
the way I used to look at them. Every year I begin
to think less of myself, and more of those about me.</p>

<p>"When my children grew up about me they were
the only ones I cared for. They were the only things
in the world that interested me. When my grandchildren
came they were new inspirations to me,
and my views toward others changed, and made me
feel better inclined."</p>

<p>"That shows, does it not, that as we grow older,
and as the world increases in age, everything improves,
our minds, the advancements in the arts,
in the sciences, in inventions, and generally in the
improvement of the human race? It is a part of the
whole education which man in his improved condition
is trying to instill, and it is human knowledge,
and the desire to learn everything, that gives a stimulus
to us."</p>

<p>There was no more welcome intelligence than the
news that on the following day they would visit the
first cave in the northern hills, and that Ephraim
would accompany them. The people in the village
were delighted at the news that the ancient caves of
the Korinos would be opened.</p>

<p>The trip took on the nature of a pleasure expedition.
Even the family of the Chief were insistent on
going along, and the boys quickly became the friends<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_152" id="p_152" href="#p_152">p. 152</a></span>
of Camma, the youngest son of Ephraim, and insisted
that he should go back with them to Wonder Island
on a visit when they returned.</p>

<p>Ephraim assented to this most heartily. They
showed Camma the workings of the revolver, and
presented him with one of them. Then, when they
went to the ship, he was presented with a camera,
and an outfit for developing.</p>

<p>When the boys brought back a small hand sewing
machine, and gave it to Mene, young Camma's sister,
the joy in that family was beyond all bounds. Ephraim
stood before the little machine, as though paralyzed.
It acted like a human being, only more perfectly,
as its work showed.</p>

<p>But now for the caves. Sufficient food was taken
along to make the trip a comfortable one. The village
in which Ephraim lived was nearly a half day's
journey from the original site of the town that was
occupied by the old Chief. He had founded the new
site, near the sea, because of the exposed condition
of the old village, and also on account of the unsanitary
condition of the surroundings.</p>

<p>The caves were near the old town, and it required
nearly five hours to make the trip, but it was enjoyable,
every step of the way. The three boys engaged
in hunting, on the way, because the new toy
in Camma's hands had to be put to use. Ephraim
put no restraint on the jolly pranks of the boys.
John was careful to tell him that Harry and George
were not wild or reckless, and that Camma would find
them healthy comrades.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon, they were told that the first
of the caves would be found in the hill toward the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_153" id="p_153" href="#p_153">p. 153</a></span>
right, and that the work of opening the principal
one would not be undertaken until after luncheon.</p>

<p>You may be sure that the boys made a hurried
meal, and without waiting for the workers to come
up, they grasped their weapons, and were soon half
way up the hill, their guide, an old man, who knew
the location of the caves, being with them, to show
the way.</p>

<p>The old man pointed to the rocky wall, and indicated
where the opening was. Ephraim had closed
it effectually, for they saw the evidence of the wall
before them, where its comparatively smooth surface
showed the difference between the natural wall
and the rough rocks elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Where is the other cave?" asked George.</p>

<p>"It is on the other side," he answered.</p>

<p>"And is that also closed?"</p>

<p>"Yes; just as you see this."</p>

<p>When the workers came up John directed them
how to commence at the top, and take out a rock at a
time. He smiled as he saw how well the work had
been done, and Ephraim was gratified at the praise
bestowed.</p>

<p>"You certainly made a first class job of ashlar
work," remarked John.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Ephraim, in surprise.</p>

<p>"It is just this kind of masonry where the courses
are irregular, and built up from the rock just as it
came from the quarry."</p>

<p>"I was not aware that there were different kinds
of masonry. I thought that masonry was merely the
placing together of stones so they would bind each
other, and that is the way I had them do it."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_154" id="p_154" href="#p_154">p. 154</a></span></p>

<p>"Masonry is one of the oldest of the arts. It is
really the foundation stone of architecture. The
work you have done here happens to be of rock that
has a rather smooth outline, that is, the stone broke
off smooth, in the upper layers, but the large pieces
near the bottom represent what is called rubble
work."</p>

<p>"This is very interesting to know," remarked
Ephraim.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; font-size: small;">[<a href="#p_153">See p. 153</a>]</p>
</div>

<p>"I might add," continued John, "that when the
courses are not regular it is called <i>broken</i> ashlar;
when stones of less than one foot in breadth are used<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_155" id="p_155" href="#p_155">p. 155</a></span>
it is called <i>small</i> ashlar; if the wall is backed by
rubble, or inferior work it is called <i>bastard</i> ashlar.
Then every kind of surface has a particular name,
like the <i>random-tooled</i>, where the tool marks are
shown in all directions; <i>rusticated</i> when only the
joined edges are trimmed up; <i>prison-rustic</i> when it
is pitted with deep holes; <i>herring-bone</i> when it
is tooled in rows of opposite directions to each other;
and <i>nigged</i> when finished up with a pointed hammer."</p>

<p>Within an hour the stones were removed and put
aside, and then Ephraim was treated to another surprise
when he was made acquainted with the little
electric flash lights which John exhibited. With
these they entered the cave.</p>

<p>All savage tribes have some sort of animals, as
pets, and dogs are the most frequent. This was the
case among these people. The dogs were with the
party, and, as usual, ahead of the procession. Two
of them went ahead on a scouting expedition, while
John and the boys, with their flash lights followed.</p>

<p>After they had gone, probably two hundred feet,
there was a slight descent apparent in the floor of the
cave, and ahead were the two dogs stretched out, lifeless.</p>

<p>George ran ahead, as he noticed them, and John
shouted out: "Do not touch them!"</p>

<p>He stopped, and looked back, and then slowly
walked up to the animals. John requested the party
to halt, and he went forward, and put his foot on one
of the dogs. "We must go back," he said.</p>

<p>"Are they dead?" asked Harry, as he came forward.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_156" id="p_156" href="#p_156">p. 156</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not take them out and see what the trouble
is?" inquired Harry.</p>

<p>"No need for that," responded John. "I know
what the trouble is."</p>

<p>"Is there any danger in the cave?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Ephraim and the natives were now alarmed. It
will be remembered that the universal belief among
the natives is, that to go into these caves unbidden,
means death. True, John had shown the fallacy of
this on several occasions, but here was positive evidence
that death had visited the dogs, and this might
be the fate of those who attempted to go on.</p>

<p>But the most alarming thing was the fact that John
himself was the one who said there was danger, and
that they must return. He did not venture to make
an explanation until they were out of the cave.</p>

<p>"There is carbonic acid in the cave, and as it is a
deadly poison we cannot go in until it is removed."</p>

<p>"That seems singular," responded George. "I
went in as far as the dogs, and it didn't affect
me."</p>

<p>"But you did not reach down to touch the dog."</p>

<p>"I saw you touch the dog, and it didn't seem to
affect you."</p>

<p>"I touched it with my feet and not with my hands."</p>

<p>"I cannot see what difference that makes."</p>

<p>"If you had touched the dog with your hands it
would have brought your face down near the floor of
the cave, and the gas is at the bottom of the cave
only."</p>

<p>"Why should it be there and not all over?"</p>

<p>"Because it is much heavier than the air we<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_157" id="p_157" href="#p_157">p. 157</a></span>
breathe, and remains at the bottom, just like water.
If you recall, this part is lower than the corridor
through which we came, so that it could not run out.
I have always observed that in all the other caves
the floors within were higher than the entrance, and
in such cases there is no liability of getting poisonous
gases."</p>

<p>"But how are we to make the investigation, under
the circumstances?"</p>

<p>"We must remove the gas."</p>

<p>"How can that be done?"</p>

<p>"Several ways are open; one would be to tap
the floor and drain the gas out, which would be difficult
to do with our resources. Another plan would
be to force in a lot of air, so as to render the gas inert,
or we might put in enough air to make it burn, and
consume it."</p>

<p>"Why, will it burn?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly; all it needs is enough air; but
I am afraid this plan will not be a very safe one for
us. If the floor of the cave is not at any place more
than four feet below the entrance, we can go about
safely, but in such case we must move about with the
utmost caution, so as not to get too much of the
gas in the system."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it will be a difficult thing to go in unless
we know absolutely where the low places are, or
unless we survey the bottom of the cave," said
George, brightening up at the idea.</p>

<p>"What would happen if we threw a light into the
bottom where the gas is?"</p>

<p>"It would be extinguished instantly," remarked
John.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_158" id="p_158" href="#p_158">p. 158</a></span></p>

<p>"That gives me an idea," asserted George.
"Why not take a lamp, and carry it ahead of us,
about three feet from the ground, and whenever that
goes out, it will show there is gas there?"</p>

<p>"That is a good observation; but I am afraid it
would be very dangerous to do that."</p>

<p>"Dangerous? I thought you said that the carbonic
gas would put out the light?"</p>

<p>"So it will; but if three parts of air should be
added to one part of the gas it will make an explosive
mixture,&mdash;that is, a mixture which will burn,
as there has been enough oxygen added to support
combustion."</p>

<p>"In what way could enough air mix with the gas
to make it burn?"</p>

<p>"By stirring it; the movement of the body might
make an admixture just above the surface of the
gas, which would burn, and that might mean a catastrophe
for us."</p>

<p>"Then we are certainly stopped at this cave."</p>

<p>"Not by any means," rejoined John, and he saw
the boys' faces smiling again. "We must make a
safety lamp."</p>

<p>"Do you mean a lamp that will not explode the
gas, although it has enough oxygen to 'support combustion,'
as you say?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. Have you ever heard of the Humphrey
Davy lamp? Well, that was invented to meet
the very condition found here."</p>

<p>"Tell us about it."</p>

<p>"In 1816 Davy discovered that a flame would not
pass through a fine wire gauze, while conducting
some experiments. It occurred to him that use<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_159" id="p_159" href="#p_159">p. 159</a></span>
could be made of this discovery by surrounding the
flame of a lamp with gauze, and the well-known lamp
was built on that principle."</p>

<p>"What I am curious to know is, that if it will not
burn the gas, will it go out if it gets down in the
gas?"</p>

</div>

<p>"Yes; because enough air, or oxygen must go
through the mesh to support combustion of the flame
itself. If it does not get enough it is smothered."</p>

<p>"Then why not make a lamp of that kind?"</p>

<p>"But where can we get enough gauze to make a
cylinder big enough to go around a lamp?"</p>

<p>John laughed at the serious predicament, which
expressed itself in the faces of the boys. "That is
true," he said; "but if we can get a small piece of<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_160" id="p_160" href="#p_160">p. 160</a></span>
tin, we can punch it full of fine holes, and probably
make that answer."</p>

<p>"We haven't anything in the way of tin large
enough to go around a lamp, but here is a round piece,
about three inches in diameter."</p>

<p>"That will answer; punch that as full of holes as
possible, and be sure they are very small."</p>

<p>"What shall we use for a lamp?"</p>

<p>John was already looking around, and soon spied
a tree in the distance that looked like a small pine,
and beneath that he found some cones, a dozen of
which were picked up.</p>

<p>"That is a pine tree, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; these cones will burn for some time."</p>

<p>"But they will not make much of a light."</p>

<p>"No; but we are not after a light, but they will
do for testing purposes."</p>

<p>The accompanying sketches show how it was made.
A plate was used for a base, on which the burning<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_161" id="p_161" href="#p_161">p. 161</a></span>
cone was placed. A half dozen twigs were then provided,
and these were bent U-shaped, after being
secured together at their middle portions, and the
lower ends held by a cord, and this was then inverted,
and a piece of thin cotton goods, of a single thickness,
only was wound around the little frame, leaving an
opening at the top, which was covered by the perforated
tin disk.</p>

<p>"There, now we have an article which provides
for the admission of air, through the cotton goods,
and the product of combustion can escape through
the perforated opening at the top."</p>

<p>The boys danced around with joy, when the cone
was ignited, and a bale, which was simply a string,
attached, so it could be carried conveniently.</p>

<p>This time they went on, far beyond the place where
the poor dogs lay. Occasionally John would lower
the device, and when it descended too far, the knot
would begin to smoke, and this was explained by the
statement that as it went into the carbon gas, less and
less air was supplied, which caused the flame to die
down.</p>

<p>The cave was similar to the others, being white
from the lime deposits, but in all their wanderings
they had never seen anything to compare with the
beautiful hangings noted in the interior, particularly
in the chambers, which they passed, one after the
other, four of which were especially admired.</p>

<p>Ephraim was intensely interested. He never had
taken the trouble to visit any of these caverns, and
was not disposed to take much stock in the many tales
that had been related about the weird interiors.</p>

<p>"I can now understand," he said, "why the natives<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_162" id="p_162" href="#p_162">p. 162</a></span>
possessed such a fear of them. I have faced many
perilous conditions, during my life here, but I confess
if I had any faith in the superstitions about these
places, they would have paralyzed me, now that I
have seen their ghostly appearance."</p>

<p>They suddenly emerged into a spacious chamber,
so large that their voices seemed to reverberate.
The flash lights were directed to all sides and to the
immense vaulted and icicle-covered ceiling. John
stood the lamp on the ground. It was free from the
dangerous gas. The floor was fairly level, but it was
covered with the broken hangings from the ceiling.</p>

<p>"I see an outlet, directly opposite the one we came
by," exclaimed George.</p>

<p>The party hastened across the intervening space.
They were traveling along the greatest length of the
chamber. Midway between the two openings were
two other side openings, and John stopped and exclaimed:
"It is true! We have found it!"</p>

<p>The boys had never seen John so agitated before.
They pressed around and requested an explanation,
but he fumbled in his pocket, and soon drew forth a
carefully wrapped piece of brown paper.</p>

<p>"This is parchment. It contains the sketch of the
cave that has been the object of my search. I believe
we are the only white people who have ever been
privileged to enter it since the chart was made three
centuries ago."</p>

<p>Ephraim, as well as the boys, glanced about them.
What was there to excite him? Other caves had the
same sort of formation, the chambers and the openings:
and while they wondered John drew a compass<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_163" id="p_163" href="#p_163">p. 163</a></span>
from his pocket, and after holding it for a while,
continued:</p>

<p>"This chamber runs north and south as you see.
We entered on the south side. It had two other outlets,
one to the east, the other to the west."</p>

<p>"Then it is the cross-shaped cave!" almost shouted
George.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered John, as he fixed his eyes on the
boys. "In the year 1620, a Spanish navigator found
a cave, of which this is a description, and within it
were found the remains of hundreds of people."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE CHART AND THE CAVES</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>John</span> pored over the map, without going any
further. Evidently something was passing in his
mind, for occasionally his eyes left the paper and he
looked about, as though undecided.</p>

<p>"Do you know any more about what they found?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there are many incomplete portions belonging
to the history, but it may be summed up by the
statement, that they also found an immense amount
of treasure, much of it in the form of solid gold.
The adventurers were wild with joy at the discovery,
and took steps to remove it.</p>

<p>"Before proceeding far they found carvings and
inscriptions, the latter of which were unintelligible
to them, but they were very curious, judging from
the few sketches which were made. But like many
men of their class they began to quarrel over the
treasure, and fought each other to the death."</p>

<p>"That was just like the fellows who lived in the
cave at the Cataract," suggested Harry.</p>

<p>"No doubt that was over the treasure, too, there,
as well as here. Four of the men escaped, only to
be chased by savages, and after finally reaching their
vessel were almost wrecked because they did not have
enough properly to man the ship.</p>

<p>"After reaching civilization, they engaged a num<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_165" id="p_165" href="#p_165">p. 165</a></span>ber
of men, and returned. Some went in, among
them two of the original discoverers. They did not
return for some days, and another party went in,
but they did not return.</p>

<p>"Only one of the four remained, and when their
companions did not return, the others took fright
and returned to the vessel. Juan Guiterez was the
name of the sole survivor of the first expedition.
The adventurers who accompanied him declared that
he and his company had lured them to the strange
isle, in order to destroy them, and on the return to
the first Spanish port, he was cast into prison, and
remained a prisoner for nearly twenty years.</p>

<p>"This chart, or what remains of it, or from which
this copy was made was written by him while in
prison, but the singular thing is, that while he was
explicit in many things, he did not leave a clue as
to the location of the island. Many of the things on
it, as you see, are very faint."</p>

<p>The boys now examined the chart for the first time.
Harry started back in surprise, as he pointed to the
chart, and looked up at John. "Why, there are the
same marks we found on the skull at Wonder
Island!" he exclaimed in great excitement.</p>

<p>"Quite true! and do you now wonder why I have
been so much interested to find the location? Chance
has thrown this opportunity our way. It is true we
might be mistaken, but the description fits."</p>

<p>It would require pages to tell about what they
found in the recesses of the cavern. Hundreds and
hundreds of skeletons were discovered, and the most
curious tablets and carvings in hieroglyphics were
scattered in the adjoining chamber.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_166" id="p_166" href="#p_166">p. 166</a></span></p>

<p>Peculiarly-formed tools, implements of warfare,
also of metal, small slabs of uniform size, and with
characters on both sides, which might have been the
historical books of the singular people who lived here
ages ago, were in profusion not only in the large
chamber, but in the most unexpected places.</p>

<p>To John it was a vast storehouse of archeological
wealth. To the boys it was much more. There were
still some things that John did not explain, and which
they wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Do you believe that the different parties went in
and never came back again?" asked George.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt but the account was true."</p>

<p>"What became of them?"</p>

<p>"They probably met the fate that almost overtook
us when we first went in," was the answer.</p>

<p>The parchment was correct in the main details, as
to the records within the cave, but there were no
treasure, nor could any trace be found of them. They
spent several days in the search, but to no avail.
The boys were not much disappointed, it may be said,
but they were gratified to know that John had accomplished
the one desire of his life, and they knew,
also, that it would be a source of great joy to the
Professor.</p>

<p>It was found that the cave entrance at the opposite
side of the hill was the northern outlet to the
same set of caverns, and Ephraim did not know of
any others that existed in the northern part, so that
they did not feel it to be desirable to take up more
time in this direction.</p>

<p>They had now found two isles, besides their own
loved island, and when they assembled that evening<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_167" id="p_167" href="#p_167">p. 167</a></span>
in the cabin of the <i>Pioneer</i>, they had a most earnest
conversation as to the results of their latest enterprise.</p>

<p>"We have sought the treasures of the islands, and
what have we accomplished?" asked George.</p>

<p>"What have we accomplished? I have been thinking
that to find the natives here, and to be able to
help them, is a pretty big thing in itself," answered
Harry.</p>

<p>"That is true," he responded, "and the same thing
might be said, also, about the wonderful products
of the islands; they are certainly worth coming here
for. I wonder what Blakely would say if he knew
of all there is here, and the knack shown by the natives
to handle the things?"</p>

<p>"I am in sympathy with your views," said John.
"Treasures, like gold and silver, are worth seeking
for, but when you find that the earth is inviting people
to till it, and there are people who, through ignorance,
do not know how the earth can be utilized, it
is a great privilege to be able to help them, and
the recollection of what you have done will be the
greatest treasure not only to you but to the poor
people that have been benefited."</p>

<p>"I think Ephraim's story is a wonderful one,"
said George, "but he could not go far. His education
was limited, but see what he has done with the
little he knew."</p>

<p>"It was curious, however, that the cannibals had
fear for him. I cannot understand that," rejoined
Harry.</p>

<p>"Savages are children only. They have the capacities
of full grown men, but have never had the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_168" id="p_168" href="#p_168">p. 168</a></span>
opportunities. Their superstitions lead them into
singular forms of reasonings. With them the deformed
are objects of curiosity, and generally, of
reverence. Those mentally deficient are regarded as
possessing a superior spirit."</p>

<p>"I remember that the Professor told us so on one
occasion, but it seems to be singular that they should
get that view. How do you account for it?"</p>

<p>"That is a trait, or, I may say, a belief which is
not at, all uncommon among civilized people.
Throughout Europe many men, who lived years ago,
are reverenced as Saints, and, who, from the accounts
given of them, were demented. Why, it is even
claimed that there is but one step from the abnormally
gifted to the insane person."</p>

<p>"Is that really so regarded among learned men?"</p>

<p>"It has been the subject of many remarkable books
which have been written to show that genius and insanity
are closely allied. Take, for instance, the
case of Blind Tom, an ignorant negro, who, although
he could not read, nor did he know a single note of
music, was able, nevertheless, to play the most marvelous
music, and repeat, at a single hearing, an entire
musical score."</p>

<p>"But such talents, as that, I have heard, is only in
some particular direction. He was not able to do
anything else," suggested George.</p>

<p>"Quite true. But it is so with what is called genius.
I once knew a learned minister, a leading professor
in one of the colleges, who was absolutely devoid
of any other phase of education, except theology.
He could not master the first rudiments of mathematics,
and knew no more of astronomy than a ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_169" id="p_169" href="#p_169">p. 169</a></span>
year old boy, but he was supreme in his particular
branch of knowledge."</p>

<p>But the great question with John and the boys
was the future. Two islands had been discovered.
Some of the mysteries of the past three years had
been solved, but others still remained; in fact, those
which interested them the most, were still shrouded
in a veil through which there was only the slightest
glimpse.</p>

<p>John felt that their first duty would be thoroughly
to explore the island to the north and west of the
village, and thus enable them to make a complete
report when they returned to Wonder Island, and
this course was finally decided upon.</p>

<p>The spirit of John had now entered Ephraim. He
had fully agreed to accompany them in the <i>Pioneer</i>,
and learn of their great work on that island. He
said that it was his duty to his children and to the
natives who had stood by him so nobly, to provide
for their future welfare.</p>

<p>He was most active in arousing the people to an
understanding of the mission of John and the boys.
Within a day, all preparations were made for the
journey through the island, and Ephraim was with
them in order to learn all that might be necessary,
so that when he returned he could advise the people.</p>

<p>For more than a week they tramped through the
attractive portions of the land, and then the day was
set for departure.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking of making a trip to your
friends in the South," said John, as they were dining
at Ephraim's home, the day before the date of sailing.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_170" id="p_170" href="#p_170">p. 170</a></span></p>

<p>"That would please me more than anything else,"
replied Ephraim. "It occurs to me that is the first
step toward peace and prosperity on the island."</p>

<p>"Then we shall sail to their village, and from that
place go to Venture Island, where we had our first
adventures, stopping, on the way at Hutoton, where
they have a criminal colony."</p>

<p>"What is that?" inquired Ephraim. "A criminal
colony?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said John. "On the large island to the
south, which we discovered before we came here we
found a singular condition of things. Near the
southern end of the island we came into contact with
a tribe ruled over by a Chief, named Beralsea, a powerful
man; in fact, there is no law there except the
will of the Chief."</p>

<p>The boys were now laughing immoderately, and
Ephraim was moved to smiles at their mirth. "It
must have been very amusing, I have no doubt," he
said.</p>

<p>"We were thinking of the jolly time we had when
Sutoto married the Chief's daughter," said George.</p>

<p>"We shall tell you all about it on our way there,"
added Harry.</p>

<p>"I was about to say," continued John, as he also
smiled at the reminiscence, that his views on theft
were most peculiar. He did not regard it as a crime
if the people stole from each other. But if they attempted
to steal from him, or tried to deceive him,
it was such a great crime, that the unfortunates were
banished to a place called Hutoton, which, as he
stated, meant the Place of Death.</p>

<p>"We were informed that it was a terrible place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_171" id="p_171" href="#p_171">p. 171</a></span>
and when a man was sentenced it also meant a like
sentence to all of his family, and that no one was
ever known to return from that horrible prison
home."</p>

<p>"I have heard, but only vaguely, that there was
such a place, but had no idea that it was so near
to us. But did you verify the character of the
place?"</p>

<p>"We went there, and instead of finding a barren
and uninviting spot, and misery and want, we saw
a lovely village, and people so much more advanced
than those in the village ruled over by the Chief, that
we were amazed.</p>

<p>"The ruler there treated us handsomely, and had
even taken care in the most kindly manner, of a white
man who had escaped the rigors of the sea some
years before, and who was demented, or incapable,
through paralysis, of recognizing those around him."</p>

<p>Ephraim started as John said this. "A white
man, did you say? How old was he? Where is he
now?"</p>

<p>"We sent him to Wonder Island where the Professor
has taken care of him, no doubt," Harry interjected.</p>

<p>"You appear agitated. Have I recalled anything
that might give a clue to his identity?" queried John.</p>

<p>"No; it could not be possible! It was merely a
passing fancy. Strange, how things sometimes will
affect you. No, I do not know that I can add anything
to your knowledge concerning him." The subject
was not again alluded to during that day.</p>

<p>Ephraim and his family were taken aboard the
<i>Pioneer</i>. Everything was marvelous to them. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_172" id="p_172" href="#p_172">p. 172</a></span>
cabin with its complete furnishings, the musical instruments,
the phonograph, the piano player, which
acted like a wizard, because it gave out the sweet musical
tones, as though it were a living thing, and then
a moving picture screen, which was the last thing the
boys installed before they left New York, made up
a series of entertainments for the family that had no
end of marvels for them.</p>

<p>"To think of it; for fifty-two years this is the first
time I have paced the decks of a vessel. It is the
happiest day of my life." And Ephraim could
scarcely keep the tears from coming. Happiness
shows itself in that way with the strongest, not with
the weakest. The strong man can stand the miseries
and the sufferings much better and with a
braver front than the weak; but excessive joy will
break him down so that he manifests it more easily.</p>

<p>John saw his emotion and sympathized with him.
Taking him by the arm he led him to the cabin forward,
and as they entered the cozy library, he pointed
to the books. This was the end of Ephraim for that
day.</p>

<p>Without leaving the room he moved from case to
case and scanned shelf after shelf, and when John,
on one occasion came in, he heard him mutter: "Is
there another place like this on earth?"</p>

<p>Late that evening the <i>Pioneer</i> took down part of
its sail as they approached land in the distance.</p>

<p>"We are nearing Hutoton," shouted George.</p>

<p>Stut ordered the whistle to blow, and before the
landing was reached the shore was lined with the
people. They soon recognized the visitors, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_173" id="p_173" href="#p_173">p. 173</a></span>
boats were prepared before the anchor finally
dropped.</p>

<p>The entire crew of the <i>Pioneer</i> went ashore, and
Ephraim was curious to see the head man, and have
a conversation about the manner in which the colony
was conducted.</p>

<p>The boys could not understand the change of plans.
Why did they not stop at the southern part of the
island, and visit the Malosos, who were supposed to
be Ephraim's enemies?</p>

<p>It was learned that John and Ephraim, after the
vessel started, concluded it would be wiser to visit
Hutoton first and get all the information possible
from them concerning the time, condition, and circumstances
of the casting ashore of the white man
found there when John and his party made their
visit.</p>

<p>In explanation of their action, it may be well, also,
to state that they still had on board of the <i>Pioneer</i>,
the white man they had rescued or taken from the
stockade in the Malosos village, and that there were
certain things in his tale that seemed improbable to
John.</p>

<p>The visit to Hutoton might be able to clear up the
mystery, and possibly establish the identity of the
paralyzed man, and in that event it would, not be
necessary to go directly to the Malosos village but
await their return from Venture Island before visiting
the village.</p>

<p>While the old man was being taken from the vessel,
George went to John and inquired: "Did he
ever tell you his name?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_174" id="p_174" href="#p_174">p. 174</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he says it is Henry D. Retlaw."</p>

<p>All noticed that he stole furtive glances about him
as he was being conveyed to the village.</p>

<p>"Were you ever here before?" asked John, as they
neared the house of the magistrate.</p>

<p>He shook his head vigorously, and answered
"No!" with a vehemence that startled John.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>RESCUE ISLAND</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>Orders</span> had gone out to prepare to receive the visitors
in true Hutoton style, but, in truth, the people
did not need any urging. The remembrance of the
last visit, when the gifts were so judiciously distributed,
was sufficient to assure a generous welcome.</p>

<p>It was out of the question to leave that night, and
John felt it to be a duty to cultivate their acquaintance,
and confer with the chief magistrate about
starting the people at work gathering the native
products.</p>

<p>John announced that within a month it was proposed
to establish regular sailings between that port
and Wonder Island, which would enable them to get
supplies and ship their products each week. This
intelligence was then imparted to the people, who
received it with the greatest enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"One of the objects of the present visit is to take
you with us to Wonder Island," said John, addressing
the leader, "so that you may learn what we are
doing, and come back prepared to instruct your people."</p>

<p>When this information was conveyed to him, he
cast down his eyes, and said sorrowfully: "But I
am a convict, like the others, and I have been con<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_176" id="p_176" href="#p_176">p. 176</a></span>demned
to stay here. If I leave this place I disobey
the law of the Chief."</p>

<p>John smiled as he replied: "I have provided for
all that. You will meet your Chief Beralsea in
Unity, the Capital of Wonder Island. Hutoton is
no longer the terrible place that the Chief pictured
to us. He told me that your assistance was necessary
to him and to the people in the colony."</p>

<p>This information was received in gratitude, and
his consent was thus readily obtained.</p>

<p>After a night of feasting, preparations were made
for the departure. Retlaw was brought to the place
where the paralyzed man was discovered, and the
leader Caramo accompanied them.</p>

<p>The moment Caramo saw him he turned to John
and said: "I have seen that face before. I am sure
he accompanied another man when on one occasion
a boat load came ashore a long way to the south of
us."</p>

<p>"How long ago was that?"</p>

<p>"Not more than three suns ago."</p>

<p>It must be understood that <i>three</i> suns meant with
these people, three years by our reckoning. When
Retlaw was examined he denied that he had ever
been on the island before, and, of course, there was
no way to discredit his statements. After all, Caramo
might be mistaken in identifying him, as they
were some distance apart at the time the island was
supposed to have been visited by Retlaw.</p>

<p>At noon of the following day the <i>Pioneer</i> weighed
anchor, and set sail for the southern port of the
northern island, there to visit Chief Ta Babeda, of
the Malolos.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_177" id="p_177" href="#p_177">p. 177</a></span></p>

<p>While they were skimming the shore south of the
village, George said: "There is one thing we have
neglected. We have had so much to do lately that
we haven't found time for it, but there is an opportunity
now."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"We have no name for the island to which we are
now going. We might consult Ephraim. It would
be hardly fair to impose any sort of name on his
country," suggested George, with a good humored
laugh.</p>

<p>Ephraim was delighted at the idea. "We must
have a name, assuredly, but it never occurred to me
before. The natives called it Rescudada; at any
rate that is as near as I can recall the pronunciation
of the word."</p>

<p>"Why, that is almost like Rescue."</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't that be a good name?" asked Ephraim.
"There has been considerable rescue work
here, and it is going on all the time."</p>

<p>"That's the name for it!" exclaimed Harry, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Suppose we notify General John and Skipper
Stut that the Geographical Society has just named
the island 'Rescue'?"</p>

<p>This important function was attended to and a
note made in the log that the island discovered in
south latitude 41&deg; 37' 10", and west longitude 138&deg; 2' 56",
by the steamship <i>Pioneer</i>, was formally named
<i>Rescue</i>.</p>

<p>Long before the village was reached the great fog
horn of the <i>Pioneer</i> commenced to give the signal.
The villagers knew what it meant, and the old Chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_178" id="p_178" href="#p_178">p. 178</a></span>
himself was at the landing place to welcome the visitors.</p>

<p>The boats were manned by the sailors, and the
boys, together with John, Ephraim, and Caramo,
were in the first boat. When Ta Babeda gazed at
Ephraim, he was astounded. John had not informed
him of the name of his visitor, but he continued
to gaze at him in amazement.</p>

<p>It was evident that the old Chief was impressed
with his appearance, so unlike anything he had ever
before known in the form of a human being. When
they arrived at the Chief's house, John awaited the
proper time before making the introductions, and
finally said:</p>

<p>"It gives me pleasure to introduce to you, the
greatest enemy you have. This is Rumisses, the
Cannibal Chief of the Umbolos."</p>

<p>The Chief was startled beyond measure. True,
he knew that John and his party had come into contact
with his arch enemy, but this was certainly a
thrilling way to bring them together.</p>

<p>Ephraim walked forward and seized the Chief by
the hand, and then pressed his nose against him.
This was, of course, symbolic of friendship.</p>

<p>The Chief unhesitatingly accepted the token, but
he could not remove his eyes. Here was the man,
so unlike all others, and the impression of superiority,
undoubtedly, was also in his mind, but Ephraim
quickly relieved him of his reflections, as he
said:</p>

<p>"Because I am so unlike you, is not due to any
particular knowledge, or favor from the Great Spirit.
I am a white man, like the Great Chief here, and was<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_179" id="p_179" href="#p_179">p. 179</a></span>
unfortunate to be cast among the natives in the north,
and I have tried for many years to prevent the practicing
of the sacrifices, and have succeeded."</p>

<p>"But we were told that all the people you captured
from us were sacrificed."</p>

<p>"It is not true. They are all living with us in
perfect happiness and contentment."</p>

<p>"Then why is it that we have been so much deceived?"</p>

<p>"Because the Korinos have not told you the truth.
They did this because they knew no better."</p>

<p>"Yes; the White Chief has told us that they have
deceived us, and I believe him. But I learn that my
Korinos have gone to you for protection!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I have shielded them, and they are now
on board of the vessel in the harbor."</p>

<p>This information brought back all the native resentment
of the old Chief. "Then he has brought
them back to me!" he exclaimed in great earnestness.</p>

<p>"I believe he intends to do so, but it will not be
until they go to Wonder Island, that marvelous
place."</p>

<p>"Then I am content."</p>

<p>John heard the conversation, and soon turned it
into another direction, when he informed the Chief
that the Chief of Venture Island as well as the leader
of the criminal colony, were to accompany them to
Wonder Island, and that the company would be incomplete
without him and his family.</p>

<p>He looked at his visitors for some time, doubting
in his mind the propriety of such a course, but the
entreaties of Ephraim, and the urging of Muro and
Uraso, were sufficient to decide the question, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_180" id="p_180" href="#p_180">p. 180</a></span>
the only matter that now weighed on his mind was
to determine who should accompany him in this wonderful
voyage.</p>

<p>Ta Babeda had never summoned up sufficient courage,
while the ship was formerly in port, to board
the vessel. His examination of the <i>Pioneer</i> was
made from the shore. Now he would step into a
new world.</p>

<p>He little knew what wonders would be exhibited to
him. The ship's band was the greatest thing he
had ever known, and he never tired of its music.
But when he saw the curious piano, the music box
that acted as though it had life, and the other evidences
of civilized arts, that were found in the cabin,
he was content to make the best of it.</p>

<p>Like all natives, as we have already stated, he
was immoderately fond of eating, and the kitchen
arrangements, where food was cooked without any
fuel, interested him beyond everything else. He
would sit at the entrance of the kitchen for minutes
at a time.</p>

<p>The push buttons, the snap switches for the electric
lights and for the cooking apparatus, were some
things which he could not understand. The little
innocent wires meant nothing to him, nor could the
boys, or even John, explain the phenomenon to him
so he could understand it.</p>

<p>The boys puzzled over this, as he was insistent
upon an explanation. What finally happened, the
very thing the boys tried to avoid in every way, came
when he touched the two wires, and formed a short
circuit through his hand.</p>

<p>He emitted one yell, and bounded out through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_181" id="p_181" href="#p_181">p. 181</a></span>
door, and it was some time before he could be induced
to make further investigations. His expressions
were very humorous, particularly when he insisted
that the wires were mad, and didn't like him,
and that they tried to pull his arms out of his shoulders.</p>

<p>Harry then took two of the wires and brought them
together, and then pulled them apart. Each time
this was done, a spark would flash. The object was
to show that two wires were necessary to produce a
circuit or a current.</p>

<p>Eventually an inspiration seemed to strike him,
as he exclaimed: "They are married! Yes, I see!"</p>

<p>The boys laughed as they told John of the circumstance,
and how utterly impossible it was to
produce a current until a circuit was established.</p>

<p>John threw himself back and roared at the recital
of the story, as told by the boys. "I think his description
is a pretty good one. Perhaps he was
thinking of the family circle?" and John continued
to laugh as the boys tried to grasp the full meaning
of his little joke.</p>

<p>But Ta Babeda was an apt pupil. He was far
more acute than Beralsea, and there scarcely was an
hour but he had one of the boys at his side trying to
fathom some of the mysteries in the new world.
This was in the nature of a picnic for the boys, who
enjoyed his curious questions and his equally unexpected
comments.</p>

<p>Ephraim, too, was generally present, as well as
Camma, his eldest son, the latter evincing remarkable
knowledge for one who had never known of the
wizardry that resides in wood and stones and iron.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_182" id="p_182" href="#p_182">p. 182</a></span></p>

<p>To Ephraim this opportunity to open the wide
world to his children must have been a heaven of
delight, and he reveled in every hour and even regretted
that nature demanded sleep. It seemed to
be better awake and seeing and feeling. Two weeks
prior to this he had merely existed; now he was a
man again, and living.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a merry party on board of the
noble ship. When the Chief, and those about him
were told that the vessel was the creation of George
and Harry, it was another occasion to marvel
over.</p>

<p>"Your boys can do the same thing, and make
other things just as wonderful," said John, as they
were commending and petting the boys.</p>

<p>"Do you think so!" asked Ta Babeda, in great
earnestness, and for the first time showing any curiosity
or indicating any desire to give his children
any advantages.</p>

<p>John saw that the leaven was working, as he replied:
"That is why I have been so anxious to have
you and your children visit our city. Your wife
and daughters will find as many surprising things to
interest them as the boys will discover."</p>

<p>The run from Rescue to Wonder Island, would
occupy, ordinarily, about ten hours, of a complete
day, and for that reason the start was made early
in the morning. Unity was about eight miles from
the sea, on a large stream, and it was desirable to
make the run through the river by daylight.</p>

<p>But shortly before noon a wind sprang up from
the west, and it increased in intensity, so that shortly
after the noon hour they were compelled to make a<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_183" id="p_183" href="#p_183">p. 183</a></span>
long tack to the south. This meant a night on board
ship, and a stormy one at that.</p>

<p>The wide, wide sea, without the sign of any land
in sight was, indeed, a fascinating thing to the natives,
and how they admired the native sailors with
whom they readily fraternized. They watched
every movement, the taking down of the sails, the
changing of the angles of the great sheets, as they
turned in their course, the handling of the tiller,
and all the paraphernalia of sailing, for the <i>Pioneer</i>
depended principally on her sailing capacity, and
not on the small engine with which she was equipped.</p>

<p>The boys explained to Camma, that upon their return
to the island a much larger engine would be
installed, so that they need not depend upon the
sails thereafter, but would be able then to sail directly
through the wind, instead of being blown back
and forth, as was now the case.</p>

<p>The wind did not abate until the morning was
breaking, and then there was a welcome change in
the direction that the storm was taking. Many of
the natives were ill, and John had the satisfaction
of administering the new and lately-discovered remedy,
namely, Atropine.</p>

<p>Shortly after ten o'clock the eastern end of Wonder
Island was sighted. The great mountain range
was visible, and the identical headland, where the
skull with the inscription was found, could be discerned
through the mild haze.</p>

<p>There was immense curiosity on board the ship as
it skirted along the shore. The Tuolo landing place
was sighted, but they continued past it. Two hours
afterward they could plainly see the dock which had<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_184" id="p_184" href="#p_184">p. 184</a></span>
been built for the use of Uraso's people, and an hour
later Muro was just as much interested to point out
to Ephraim and Ta Babeda the landing station of
his tribe.</p>

<p>Immediately after luncheon, George, who was always
on the alert, ran through the vessel, with his
field glass in hand, and announced that the <i>Wonder</i>,
the large steamship, which made trips to Chili, was
coming up in the distance, and heading, as they were,
for the mouth of Enterprise River, which flowed past
the city.</p>

<p>All were intensely excited at the announcement,
and rushed forward to get a glimpse of the great
ship. As she came up the streamers began to fly
from every spar and mast, and Harry ran up to Stut,
and asked why the <i>Pioneer</i> did not have them out.</p>

<p>"But they are ready and will be flown as soon as
we get nearer." As he said this the first ones were
unfurled. Then the <i>Wonder</i> blew three long blasts
which the <i>Pioneer</i> answered.</p>

<p>"They are going to let us go in first," said John.
Such was, indeed, the case, for the <i>Wonder</i> slowed
down, and the <i>Pioneer</i> entered the mouth of the
river, for the last eight miles of the eventful cruise.</p>

<p>Two miles from the town both vessels began to
blow signals with the fog horns, and long before the
wharf was reached the people began to flock from
all sides.</p>

<p>One little incident pleased the boys beyond all
measure. On the bridge, and furiously waving his
arms, and swinging an American flag was Sutoto,
with his bride by his side.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_185" id="p_185" href="#p_185">p. 185</a></span></p>

<p>"So Sutoto has been on a wedding trip to Chili?"
remarked Harry.</p>

<p>Such was the case, as they afterwards learned.
Both boys were busy explaining the sights and the
locations of the different buildings to Beralsea and
Ephraim, and the latter was much affected as he
saw the flag floating from the tall staff in the principal
square of the city.</p>

<p>Beralsea had seen Sutoto wave the flag from the
bridge of the <i>Wonder</i>, and when he saw the same
sort of emblem on the staff, he inquired of Ephraim
the meaning of the curious thing. It was then explained
to him that it was the magic combination
of colors which their great tribe believed in, and
which was always raised above them wherever they
were, as a symbol that they were protected by it.</p>

<p>"But how can that protect the people? Is there
something in it like the unseen lightning, which we
have on the ship?"</p>

<p>"Unseen lightning, is a pretty good name, coming
from a savage," remarked Harry in an undertone.</p>

<p>"No; not in that way," answered Ephraim, "but
whenever people see it, wherever they may be, they
know that the tribe is great enough to give protection
to any one who may try to injure any member
of our tribe."</p>

<p>"The White Chief has told me that there are
many islands and countries, and that the world is
round, and is peopled by many different tribes. Do
the people everywhere know that 'flag,' as you call
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; in every part of the world."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_186" id="p_186" href="#p_186">p. 186</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are those two men standing there alone?"
asked Ta Babeda.</p>

<p>"I do not know," responded Ephraim. "This is
the first time I have been here. The boys will
know."</p>

<p>"That," answered George, "is the Professor,&mdash;that
is, the man with a white beard and hair. The
large man by his side is Beralsea, the Chief of the
tribe on Venture Island."</p>

<p>Ephraim looked at Ta Babeda for a moment, with
an amused smile, and then remarked: "He is almost
as large as you are."</p>

<p>The <i>Wonder</i> was the first to get her cables to the
dock, and as she swung against the wharf, and the
gang plank was fixed in place, the first ones to spring
ashore were Sutoto and Cinda, the latter of whom
rushed to her father's outstretched arms, and then
to her mother and the other members of the family.</p>

<p>The boys did not know how or where to extend
the first greetings. There was Sutoto and Lolo, and
the dear old Professor, who considerately kept in the
background, but the boys insisted on giving him the
first greeting.</p>

<h3>THE RETURN TO WONDER ISLAND</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>"That</span> was an awfully sly thing to do, as soon as
our backs were turned," said George, as Sutoto and
Cinda were finally free from the vigorous greetings.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Cinda.</p>

<p>"To run away without giving us notice!"</p>

<p>"But we have seen the great wide world, and it is
wonderful, and I can never tell the people here how
grand it is."</p>

<p>And then the boys looked at Cinda, and when they
saw the latest fashions displayed, the prettiest gown,
the neatest slippers, and the stunning hat they took
off their caps, and made a neat bow in recognition
of that feminine touch of character which so readily
adapts the sex for acquiring the latest fashions
wherever they may be.</p>

<p>Every one was wild with excitement. "There is
Blakely!" shouted Harry. "Hurrah! old boy! We
have the place for you to visit, as soon as possible.
The finest island you ever saw, and the people all
ready for business."</p>

<p>"My hands are full now; we must have another
ship. Look at the <i>Wonder</i>; she is so full of goods
that we are more than eight hours behind time. But
I am arranging for another steamer."</p>

<p>"Too bad that we are finding more islands than<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_188" id="p_188" href="#p_188">p. 188</a></span>
you can handle," responded George; "I suppose we
shall have to find another manager?"</p>

<p>"Or several assistants," said Blakely.</p>

<p>"What are all these men here for?" asked Harry.
"Why the whole island must have come to town."</p>

<p>"Well, we have had to send for all the spare men
from the different tribes. Fifty of the Tuolos just
came in this morning, and thirty of the Illyas arrived
yesterday, with their families. The <i>Wonder</i>
must be unloaded, and start back again before six
this evening. But what did you find that looks as
good as Venture Island?"</p>

<p>"Rescue Island; a dandy place, and much bigger
than Venture Island. And what do you think? We
found a chief there who is a white man," remarked
George.</p>

<p>"A white man? Where is he from?"</p>

<p>"Massachusetts; and he is humpbacked, but as
bright as can be."</p>

<p>"I saw him, did I not? He was on the <i>Pioneer</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there he is with Ta Babeda."</p>

<p>"Ta what?"</p>

<p>"That's the Chief's name who owned the other
tribe on Rescue Island. Isn't he an immense fellow?
But he is a brick; I can tell you. Come over
and I'll introduce you," and Harry pulled Blakely
over while the latter resisted, as the men were constantly
besieging Blakely for orders.</p>

<p>"Never mind the work now. Get acquainted with
the <i>big</i> men first," and the Professor laughed as he
saw the boys forcibly tug at Blakely and haul him
over to the group.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_189" id="p_189" href="#p_189">p. 189</a></span></p>

<p>"This is one of the big men we have on the island,"
said Harry to Ta Babeda, and the latter looked at
Blakely for a moment, and began to smile, for while
Blakely was chunky he was not at all large, if the
Chief might be taken as a standard.</p>

<p>He took Ta Babeda's hand, and welcomed him
most heartily, and then turned to Ephraim, and also
extended a greeting.</p>

<p>"This is the man who does all the business," said
Harry, "and he is going to make you a visit." At
this point they were interrupted.</p>

<p>"Shall we store all the pineapples aft," said a man
hurriedly.</p>

<p>"No; put them amidship," he answered.</p>

<p>"We have no crates for the vegetables," said another.</p>

<p>"Never mind, put them in the large boxes, and they
can be crated on the way."</p>

<p>"Some more men have just come; what shall we
put them at?" was the report of another, and so
from one to the other, Blakely was ever ready with
a prompt answer.</p>

<p>The Chiefs and Ephraim watched and wondered
at Blakely and his constant readiness to entertain
them, meanwhile giving orders to hundreds of the
workers who were crowding about. It was an object
lesson of what business meant, and the boys felt
proud and happy to see the great ability which he
displayed.</p>

<p>But what a happy day it was for the Professor.
He and John were in close conference, after the
formal introductions were over. "There is some<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_190" id="p_190" href="#p_190">p. 190</a></span>thing
brewing," said George as he nudged Harry,
and cast a glance toward the place where they stood
in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>"I do believe John is telling him about the copper
box; and by the way, he has never spoken about
that since we took it out of the cave. That is just
what he is doing; see, he is indicating the size of it."</p>

<p>Harry laughed, as he answered: "I am satisfied
they will not do anything rash, without consulting
us," and George laughed at Harry's view of the
case.</p>

<p>They had been absent from the island a little over
a month. During their absence the new hotel was
completed and was now in running order. This became
the headquarters for the visitors. While it
was only two stories in height, it contained nearly
a hundred rooms, and the utmost effort was made to
make all of them comfortable.</p>

<p>The boys had their own rooms, and could not be
induced to give them up. John and the Professor
also maintained their old rooms, which were most
comfortable, and attached to the Professor's apartments
was a large room where the people came daily
to see him and consult about their many wants.</p>

<p>He never failed to see them. It mattered not who
called, it was unvarying custom to greet all alike.
The affection for him in the minds of the people grew
stronger day by day.</p>

<p>There were now five of the Chiefs on Wonder
Island permanent residents in Unity. A great
change had come over the feelings of the people
with respect to the ownership of land. When the
town was laid out, and the people began to flock to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_191" id="p_191" href="#p_191">p. 191</a></span>
the place, attracted by its many advantages, it began
to look for a time as though the different Chiefs
soon would find themselves without subjects.</p>

<p>In addition to this the Professor recognized that
too many of the people were expecting to be put to
work in the city, and this would cause agriculture to
be abandoned, whereas it was obvious that they must
depend upon the soil for sustenance.</p>

<p>John and the Professor therefore developed a
plan which would be the means of keeping the people
in their own sections, or, at least, encourage them
to till the ground.</p>

<p>The Chiefs in Wonder Island owned the soil.
Their people reserved to themselves the right to hunt
and to gather the fruits and nuts necessary to sustain
life. But they had no right whatever, independently
of the Chiefs.</p>

<p>The first step, therefore, was to gain the consent
of these rulers to a division of the land, so that all
their people might have farms. Uraso and Muro
were the first to agree to the plan, and it was quickly
followed by all except the Tuolos and the Illyas.</p>

<p>The Chiefs themselves, under this plan, were to
receive one quarter of the acreage, and of the residue,
one-third was to be turned into what was called
a state fund, to be used for schools and for administrative
purposes, while the balance was to be given
to the people, who were to select their own land.</p>

<p>For the purpose of enabling proper deeds to be
made, it was necessary to make a survey of the
islands, and this had been completed six months
previously, so that many of the people who now understood
that the lands selected belonged to them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_192" id="p_192" href="#p_192">p. 192</a></span>
and could not be taken from them without their consent,
were only too happy to consent to remain on
their own land.</p>

<p>But here another problem presented itself. It was
desirable that the people should build homes on these
farms, and Blakely and John evolved the plan to
provide certain quantities of lumber, at a low price,
to be paid for from the products of the land. This
had a most stimulating effect, and applications were
coming in from every quarter. As a result small saw
mills were put up in the territorial limits of each of
the tribes, so that it was an easy matter for the people
to get the lumber near home.</p>

<p>But that which taxed the energies of Blakely most,
was to provide the farming implements and the seed
and instruction necessary to start them on the way.
As it was impossible to provide all the tools and
implements required for this purpose, Blakely had
recourse to the States, and by inserting a few advertisements
in the agricultural papers throughout
our country, it was not long before the implements
were forthcoming, all of which were paid for from
the reserve fund which had been provided.</p>

<p>And now another thing of the utmost importance
happened. It was noised about from Maine to California
that there was an immense opportunity to
make money in the now well-known Wonder Island.
Every return trip of the <i>Wonder</i> from the nearest
South American port, brought Americans, with funds
to invest in plantations and in setting out coffee
trees and banana groves.</p>

<p>Many Americans came from the great ranches of
South America, particularly Brazil, which furnishes<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_193" id="p_193" href="#p_193">p. 193</a></span>
full three-fourths of all the coffee of commerce.
These men went through the islands and began the
barter for the lands.</p>

<p>At first this was encouraged, but it was soon, discovered
that the shrewd, and, more frequently than
otherwise, the unscrupulous traders were cheating
the unsophisticated people, so that the Professor had
to take a firm hand, and declare that no transfers
would be made until the sales had been investigated.</p>

<p>This made the prices of lands go up by leaps and
bounds, and the Professor told the people that they
should not sell their holdings, as it would be much
better for them to own and till the farms than to sell
them and then work for the owners.</p>

<p>All this tended to make the people appreciate that
they really owned something&mdash;that they had wealth
and power within their grasp. Then began, or
rather was carried out more systematically, the
founding of schools, and by many means the parents
themselves were induced to attend the schools.</p>

<p>All were taught English. With the large funds
that the state had obtained in selling a portion of
the state lands, the Professor sent for teachers from
the United States, and these came prepared to take
up the work all over the island.</p>

<p>The most interested workers were the Korinos, as
they were called on Rescue Island, and Krishnos on
Wonder Island. The Professor's first work, after
the conquest of the savages, was to educate those
people for teaching, and in this they were found to be
very efficient workers.</p>

<p>The Korinos brought from Rescue were placed
under the tuition of the Krishnos, and it was sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_194" id="p_194" href="#p_194">p. 194</a></span>prising
to see how happily they regarded their lot,
and what progress they made after they understood
what was required.</p>

<p>Although we have not a full account of all the
products shipped from Wonder Island during the
first six months, it might be stated that during the
last thirty days, the shipments from the port of
Unity, comprised 60,000 pounds of coffee, eighteen
tons of bananas, and six hundred quintals of spices,
besides over four hundred tons of fibres, of which
jute formed one-half.</p>

<p>It is estimated that within another year, when
many of the large plantations should be ready to
yield their products, that amount would be increased
to such an extent that several additional ships would
be necessary to carry the tonnage.</p>

<p>The foregoing is particularly instanced to show
what John could point out to the Chiefs who were
now their guests, and to impress upon them the
necessity and value of adopting such a land system
as they had established.</p>

<p>Ephraim readily understood and approved of the
plan, but it was not so easy for Ta Babeda, and
Beralsea. At the quiet suggestion of John the opportunity
was made whereby they were constantly
thrown into contact with the resident chiefs. Within
a week they accepted the suggestions and a half
dozen surveyors were commissioned to go to the
islands and take up the work of surveying the lands,
and making records, which were to be put into such
form that the Chiefs would understand them.</p>

<p>One day Ephraim, in conversation with John said:
"I want my boys to remain with you until they re<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_195" id="p_195" href="#p_195">p. 195</a></span>ceive
their education. I see that the opportunities
for work are unlimited, and I would also like to send
over a number of young men for the same purpose."</p>

<p>"Your decision pleases us immensely," said John,
"and I have been wondering why your daughter
would not also like to remain for a time, as there is
much she can learn that will be of great help to you."</p>

<p>Ephraim was silent for a while, while he looked
at John, and he finally answered: "That means
my wife will remain here also. But that has my
hearty consent. It will be for their good, and for
the good of my people."</p>

<p>It was not long before Ta Babeda heard of Ephraim's
decision, and he adapted the same course to
the delight of his children. As for Beralsea, his
favorite daughter was already the wife of the Chief
Sutoto, of the Berees, and it was certain that she
would remain in Unity, so that there was no difficulty
in getting his consent to sending his children
and others who would carry on the work of education.</p>

<p>But the boys had not, in the meantime, forgotten
their factory. The old water wheel was still there.
Money could not purchase it, and they would not
permit its removal. It was the same old crude
wheel built nearly three years before at the Cataract,
at the other end of the island, not more than two
miles from the rocky shore where the sea gave them
up.</p>

<p>After the return there had been so much to see
and to learn, about the new developments, and the
visitors required so much attention that the boys
quite forgot the copper box, and to inquire about<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_196" id="p_196" href="#p_196">p. 196</a></span>
the condition of the paralyzed man who was found
at Hutoton.</p>

<p>"The Professor has just told me," remarked
John, "that the old man is improving, and hopes that
within another month he will be able to talk."</p>

<p>"Has he any idea of what his name is?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. He keeps mumbling something
about <i>the triangle</i>, or something of that kind, but
that is, of course, unintelligible."</p>

<p>"I understand Retlaw is improving, also?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we have thought of bringing the two men
together, as soon as the paralytic is so improved that
he can talk."</p>

<p>"I have often wondered what kind of a disease
paralysis is?" inquired Harry.</p>

<p>"Paralysis is not a disease of itself. It is merely
a sign of some disorder of the nervous system. It
may be shown by complete disability on one side of
the body, or in some particular portion, and only
certain sets of nerves may be affected."</p>

<p>"But what seems so singular is, that he is not
only unable to speak but he cannot move about."</p>

<p>"The form of paralysis, which affects the memory,
is called <i>dementia paralytica</i>, and attacks the
brain, while some portion of the body also may be
affected."</p>

<p>"Isn't it curable?"</p>

<p>"There is little hope for a permanent cure. If
the attack should come on suddenly it is the most
dangerous. Where it seems to approach gradually,
there is more likelihood of being able to check it."</p>

<p>"In what way is there an improvement in the old
man?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_197" id="p_197" href="#p_197">p. 197</a></span></p>

<p>"So far as the bodily ailment is concerned he is
gaining. When he was brought back he was unable
to utter a single word, nor could he move himself
in any way, except with one arm, and that only to
a small degree. Now he is able to shuffle along,
across the room, and sometimes tries to say something,
which is not distinct. The only thing which
thus far seems intelligible is the word <i>triangle</i>, as I
have stated."</p>

<p>"Harry spoke about the copper box this morning.
Have you opened it yet?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I wouldn't think of doing it unless you
were present. The Professor and I have had several
talks about it, but we have all been so busy that
the matter has been deferred from time to time. I
hope we shall be able to get at it to-night."</p>

<p>While thus engaged in conversation the Professor
appeared, smiling and happy. The boys greeted
him affectionately, as was their custom always.</p>

<p>"Do you want to make a visit with me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; where?" asked George.</p>

<p>"We will go out on B Street first," he answered.</p>

<p>Together they passed the large school house, and
crossed the open square, and entered the most beautiful
of all the streets, the one laid out with rows
of trees along the curbs, and flower beds along the
middle portion of the driveway.</p>

<p>"Can you guess where we are going?" asked the
Professor.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you see the newly-painted house to the
right?"</p>

<p>"Is that where Sutoto lives?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_198" id="p_198" href="#p_198">p. 198</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; there is Cinda. Isn't she happy, though?"</p>

<p>They went in and were accorded a happy welcome.
Her father, the Chief, Beralsea, and her mother,
Minda, were there, but Sutoto was absent.</p>

<p>"And where is the bridegroom?" asked the Professor.</p>

<p>"He is in the yard somewhere. I will call him."
And she tripped out the steps, merry as a lark.</p>

<p>Sutoto came in, and the boys simply shouted at
his appearance. He was covered with dirt and
grease, and made no great effort to conceal the fact.</p>

<p>"And what have you been up to?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Come out and I will show you."</p>

<p>In the little "garage," if it might be so termed,
was an auto, one which Sutoto had purchased and
brought back with him on his wedding trip. "I was
going to send for you," he said, addressing Harry,
"because I have been having trouble with the carbureter."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>THE SAVAGES AT UNITY</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>The</span> boys were simply wild with delight, and
George commenced to laugh immoderately, after
viewing the brightly-polished machine.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? Anything wrong? Is it
upside down?" asked Sutoto.</p>

<p>"No; I was just thinking how funny it seems that
one of the wild savages of the island should be the
first to import an automobile."</p>

<p>Sutoto didn't in the least mind this allusion to his
former condition, but the boys were the only ones
who dared to jest with him in this manner. He
joined in the laugh, but quickly replied:</p>

<p>"But I am not the only one favored in this way."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I know some other people who are indulging in
pleasure cars also."</p>

<p>"Who is that?"</p>

<p>"Well, Blakely has one, a fine little car he calls a
'runabout.'"</p>

<p>"He never said anything about it. Then he
brought one over for John, and another for the Professor,
but you must keep quiet; they are not to know
anything about it."</p>

<p>"Then there are two more machines down there
that have queer names on them, because the fellows<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_200" id="p_200" href="#p_200">p. 200</a></span>
themselves are peculiar, and are awfully civilized,"
said Sutoto, with a faint attempt at a smile.</p>

<p>Harry laid down the wrench and turned to Sutoto.
"What are the names?" he asked, for the first time
interested.</p>

<p>"On one it says 'Mayfield,' and 'Crandall' on the
other." And Sutoto said this without cracking a
smile, or indicating that he really knew who the
names applied to.</p>

<p>Probably, no one on the island, at least among the
natives, really knew the boys by any other designation
than George and Harry. The surnames were
of no use. Sutoto was simply "Sutoto," and no
more, and so with Uraso and Muro.</p>

<p>The Professor and the old Chief heard the hilarity,
and were soon out of the house, and although the
boys and Sutoto tried to push the machine behind
the garage, they were too late for the Professor's
quick eye.</p>

<p>He laughed when he saw the commotion. "It is all
right; if I were not so old, I would get one myself."</p>

<p>"That's just the time you need it," said Harry.
"By the way," he continued, "I will bring it around
to your place this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Bring what?" asked the Professor.</p>

<p>"Your car; of course." And Sutoto and the boys
laughed at the Professor's discomfiture.</p>

<p>"I thought there was some job about to be put
up on me. I wondered why Blakely tried to keep
me out of the warehouse yesterday."</p>

<p>But while this merry scene was taking place, five
new machines were coming along B Street, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_201" id="p_201" href="#p_201">p. 201</a></span>
Blakely in the first one, and a competent chauffeur in
each of the others.</p>

<p>"The first is yours, Harry, and the next one, with
the red body is yours, George," said Blakely. "I
thought we should surprise you."</p>

<p>"Why, there is John, too!" exclaimed Sutoto.</p>

<p>"Yes; he is in his car; he was greatly surprised.
But the Professor's car is a neat one; don't you
think so?"</p>

<p>The boys had no ears for any one or for anything.
Each was a forty-horse power roadster, while the
Professor's car had a five-passenger body, was handsomely
upholstered, and equipped with particularly
easy-riding springs. John's machine was equally
well built, and after the boys had made a full examination
of their own treasures, they investigated the
other cars, and marveled at their beauty and appearance
of comfort.</p>

<p>The procession of the machines naturally attracted
the people who came from all directions to witness
the wonder wagons which ran by themselves. They
crowded around, and listened to every comment.
The old Chief was the one most excited at the strange
things.</p>

<p>Neither Sutoto nor Cinda had informed them of
the autos, because it was intended to have quite a
surprise party, and it was afterwards learned that
Blakely and Sutoto had planned to give all of them a
surprise. The fact that the Professor and the boys,
having gone to Sutoto that morning, were absent
from their homes, precipitated to disclosure, so that
John was found and together they went to Sutoto's
house.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_202" id="p_202" href="#p_202">p. 202</a></span></p>

<p>You may be sure that it did not take the boys long
to learn the mysteries of the machines, and they
were with Sutoto, until he got the hang of the motor,
and could spin along as fast as any of them.</p>

<p>The old Chief was finally induced to get into the
Professor's machine, and the latter instructed the
driver to proceed slowly. Minda, who was with
them, was the braver of the two, by far. The speed
was about six miles an hour, at which the Chief marveled.</p>

<p>Then, gradually, the driver speeded up, until they
were making a comfortable speed of fifteen miles
an hour. As confidence increased the pleasure grew
stronger, and before they returned on the first trip
he was as determined as could be to have one for his
own use.</p>

<p>Blakely took note of his wish, and said: "I shall
see to it that on the return trip one of the machines
will be shipped to you, but it will be two weeks before
the <i>Wonder</i> comes in."</p>

<p>From that day on Sutoto had his hands full entertaining
the Chief, but the boys relieved him of
much of this, by taking him from place to place,
where he saw the work going on in all parts of the
beautiful country, and witnessed the planting of the
groves, the gathering of the crops, and the way in
which the produce was handled at the wharf.</p>

<p>Sutoto's home was a beautiful structure of five
rooms, all nicely furnished, the gift of the Professor.
The boys enjoyed the visits there. Sutoto was
always a boy to them, and Cinda a happy bride,&mdash;and
a woman of whom any one might be proud.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_203" id="p_203" href="#p_203">p. 203</a></span></p>

<p>When Beralsea, her father, decided that his children
must remain and attend the schools there, the
adjoining cottage was prepared for them, and Minda
consented to stay, but Beralsea, who had now partaken
of the commercial instincts, under the tutelage
of Blakely, was determined to return at once and
revolutionize the condition of affairs in Venture
Island.</p>

<p>That day he and Ta Babeda had a long conversation,
and together they visited John and Ephraim,
and then called in Blakely. The boys were present,
of course, and it then turned out that they had agreed
upon a plan to start the agricultural work in the two
islands conjointly, and the only question which remained
was to take care of the management of the
work.</p>

<p>Both of the Chiefs declared that they did not possess
the qualifications to direct the work, and Ephraim
pleaded age as the reason why it would be impossible
to undertake the burdens.</p>

<p>"I have an idea," he said, "that the best solution
would be to make George and Harry the managers
for the islands. I have been with the boys for some
time, and see what they are capable of, and every
one would be glad to work under them."</p>

<p>The boys were, of course, somewhat confused at
the encomium, and the Professor came to their rescue.
"These are my boys," he said. "I have
known them ever since they came to the island.
They have been with me under every condition of
service. We have had hours and days of pleasure,
and of trials, such as few have undergone, and al<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_204" id="p_204" href="#p_204">p. 204</a></span>ways,
whatever the circumstances, they have been
manly, and never gave up, although sometimes things
seemed hopeless.</p>

<p>"You have seen how, through their ingenuity, they
have built the water wheel, the mills and the factories.
Fortune has been kind to them; they do not
need the money that may come to them, as they have
found riches here, far greater than you know, but
they have loved the work, for the pleasure it has
brought them, and it is for them to decide."</p>

<p>"Harry and I have talked about these things many
times," answered George. "When we first came to
the island, we had nothing. For our own preservation
we set about to better our condition, began to
build the things necessary to maintain life, and to
protect ourselves.</p>

<p>"What at first was a necessity, later became a
pleasure, because we could see, day after day, how
we built the shop and the machinery out of the crude
things; it would be hard to leave that work now."</p>

<p>Harry approvingly nodded his head, as he responded:
"I consider it a pleasure to do anything
which would help the people here. George and I feel
that it would be wrong to leave them, so long as we
can be of service to them.</p>

<p>"The money we have will not make us happy; that
I know, unless we can use it to do some good. And
it is so with our time, also. I am as willing to give
that as money, because we have been amply rewarded
and now our duty is to the people here."</p>

<p>As a result of the conference it was agreed that
George and Harry should take up the management of
the affairs on Venture and Rescue Islands, they to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_205" id="p_205" href="#p_205">p. 205</a></span>
decide which should be the particular sphere of each.</p>

<p>The Chiefs were immensely pleased at this arrangement,
and the first steps were taken to put their
plans into execution.</p>

<p>John advised them that they should decide which
island each would take, and then each should cultivate
the acquaintance of the young men that the
Chiefs should select, so that the administrative functions
could be instilled into them, and that they might
be taught the business qualifications necessary.</p>

<p>George laughingly remarked that as the Chief
Beralsea had so accommodatingly captured him,
when they first arrived on the island, he thought that
their intimate acquaintance, which was so long prior
to Harry's should decide the matter in his favor, by
taking Venture Island.</p>

<p>"That suits me all right. I have one advantage
over you on Rescue Island; and that is the caves.
You haven't even an excuse for a cave."</p>

<p>"But I have Hutoton, that terrible place where the
criminals live," retorted George, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"And that reminds me; what about the copper
box?"</p>

<p>The boys wended their way to the Professor, and
were delighted to find John there. "Before we go
we want to have the copper box opened," remarked
Harry.</p>

<p>"I have just brought it around, in the machine,"
said John, as he noticed the boys peering at it
through the window.</p>

<p>"What is that in the package lying on the box?"</p>

<p>"Can't you guess?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_206" id="p_206" href="#p_206">p. 206</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you forgotten the skull with the inscription
on it?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean the skull we found on the headland
at the eastern end of the island?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why, what is that for? Do you think it has anything
to do with the box?"</p>

<p>"Probably not; but I was curious to examine it
further in view of the similarity of the chart and the
inscription."</p>

<p>The boys could not possibly understand what was
meant by such a reference. While they were talking
the Professor entered the room, and remarked,
"I have just come from the old fellow, and his reason
is returning under the treatment, and he is also
better physically."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the paralytic?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but there is one thing which is singular,
and that is the constant muttering of the word <i>triangle</i>.
This morning I could plainly distinguish
several other words, such as 'of' and 'three,' and
'very well,' and parts of other words, showing that
in time, if his improvement continues, we may get
more information."</p>

<p>"I have an idea," hurriedly shouted George as he
broke for the door. "Wait for me," he said, as he
turned around and cast a glance back into the room.
"I will be back at once," were the last words they
heard.</p>

<p>John laughed at George's precipitous flight. "I
suppose he has just thought of something that bears
on the case. In the meantime, and while George is<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_207" id="p_207" href="#p_207">p. 207</a></span>
away, you, Harry, might get a hammer and a cold
chisel. We may have to cut the top off."</p>

<p>Harry rushed out and taking John's machine was
quickly at the shop, where he secured a hammer and
several cold chisels capable of cutting the copper.</p>

<p>When he returned George was there, and was unfolding
the paper scrap which they found below the
skull. "Probably, this will explain the triangle,"
said George, as he pointed to the V-shaped mark.
"The upper part of it is very likely worn away, so
that we cannot see it."</p>

<p>John smiled at the suggestion as he took the paper
and carefully examined it. "Your view may be correct,"
he responded.</p>

<p>"That looks like a suggestion of a line," said
Harry, pointing to a faint scratch near the upper
margin.</p>

<p>The Professor's messenger came in hurriedly, and
announced that the paralytic had sent for him. "I
will return by the time the box is opened," said the
Professor, as he hurriedly went out of the door.</p>

<p>"Now for the box," said Harry. The slitting
chisel was applied, and he dextrously cut along the
top, under the directions of John.</p>

<p>"Direct the chisel downwardly, to see if there is
any seam to be found along the side," directed John.</p>

<p>"Yes; here is the place where the top was put on,"
shouted Harry.</p>

<p>"Why, it has been soldered," said George.
"Well, that means business."</p>

<p>It was evident that the soldering was effectively
done, because the solder had run entirely through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_208" id="p_208" href="#p_208">p. 208</a></span>
seam, and it was really sweated on. The copper
used was about an eighth of an inch thick, and the
soft and ductile character showed that it was pure
metal.</p>

<p>"Be very careful as you get around so as not to
disturb the contents, by the falling of the lid," said
John.</p>

<p>It still adhered at various places, and this was
carefully cut away by one of the thin chisels, and the
lid finally raised at one corner, sufficiently to disclose
a portion of the contents, which appeared to be round
and white, and resting near the center of the space.</p>

<p>All caught a glimpse of it, and involuntarily
started back in surprise. It was a skull, the counterpart
of the one lying on the table which contained
the inscription.</p>

<p>"Open it wide," said John in a peculiar voice, and
as he did so the Professor rushed in and announced
that the paralytic had recovered speech, and he had
ordered him to be brought in.</p>

<p>While the Professor was saying this, John was
slowly raising the lid, and by a quick motion tore it
away, and the Professor was actually taken aback
at the sight before him. He gazed for a moment,
and then muttered: "And the same inscription
too!"</p>

<p>All looked toward it in amazement, and while puzzling
over its meaning, the paralytic was helped in
by two attendants. He came forward, saw the two
skulls, and before either could prevent it he collapsed
and fell to the floor, apparently lifeless.</p>

<p>He was gathered up and placed on a couch, and
restoratives applied by the Professor. He lay thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_209" id="p_209" href="#p_209">p. 209</a></span>
in a stupor for more than a half hour, but soon returning
consciousness began to manifest itself, and
when he opened his eyes, and glanced about, his lips
began to move. Here the Professor held up a warning
hand, which he seemed to heed, for he immediately
closed his eyes, and was soon asleep, as his
breathing became regular, and the pulse began to act
normally.</p>

<p>"There must be no more agitation now," said the
Professor. "We can take the box to the adjoining
room." This was done, and John carefully lifted
the skull from its resting place, bringing with it a
mass of other material, which looked like brown or
discolored parchment.</p>

<p>The skulls were placed side by side. They were
singularly alike, the inscription of the one found on
the headland, was on the left side, and the like figures
of the one taken from the box were on the right
side.</p>

<p>"That is a singular thing," said Harry.</p>

<p>"So it is," answered John, "but it doubtless has
a meaning," he continued.</p>

<p>Beneath the box, and attached to the wrappings,
was a mass of material which John eagerly seized,
and began to unwrap, while the Professor interestedly
looked on. There was not the first sign of any
treasure in the box, and when the several folds of the
parchment were unrolled, the boys could see the
hieroglyphics that the Professor and John so eagerly
scanned.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I knew you would come back," said the
man in the adjoining room, and John dropped the
parchment and followed the Professor into the room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_210" id="p_210" href="#p_210">p. 210</a></span>
where they saw the old man sitting on the couch and
staring about with an inquiring countenance.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" said the Professor.</p>

<p>He did not answer at first but looked at John and
the Professor in amazement.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?" he then muttered, without
changing his countenance. "I have told you over
and over," he continued.</p>

<p>"Do you know where you are?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Certainly. You may ask Walter about that."</p>

<p>"Walter? Do you know Walter?" asked George,
almost involuntarily.</p>

<p>He smiled and nodded his head. "He is here. I
saw him yesterday. I wish he would explain."
Then he dropped back on the couch and remained
motionless.</p>

<p>The effort to arouse him was useless, and the Professor
advised patience. There was something so
peculiar about the whole situation that it fascinated
the boys. What did this man know about Walter?
Possibly, through him the great mystery, that commenced
with the note in the seat of their boat, would
be explained.</p>

<p>After they came back to the island, Retlaw rapidly
recovered, and was frequently found wandering
around the town. On several occasions he called on
the Professor. To the surprise of all he appeared
at this time, surprised to find John and the boys
present, and appeared to be terribly startled on seeing
the two skulls.</p>

<p>The moment he saw the paralytic, he became agitated,
and started for the door. John barred the
way, and said: "Do you know that man?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_211" id="p_211" href="#p_211">p. 211</a></span></p>

<p>In a hesitating voice, he answered: "Yes; I know
him well. Where did you find him?" and notwithstanding
he saw the quiet figure he drew back with
an expression of fear and hesitancy.</p>

<p>George slyly drew forth the Walter note, referred
to in the previous volume, "Adventures on Strange
Islands," and handed it to John. The latter seized
it and said: "Did you ever see this?"</p>

<p>He grasped the paper, and answered: "Where
did you get this? Did he have it?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the Professor; "we found it in a
recess at the end of a seat in our boat,&mdash;the one we
made on this island, three years ago."</p>

<p>"I do not know how it could have gotten there.
It was written to Clifford,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"John B. Clifford?" asked Harry in excitement.</p>

<p>Retlaw turned, when he heard Harry. "Yes,"
was the hesitating answer.</p>

<p>"Do you know Walter?" asked John.</p>

<p>He did not reply, but glanced at all of them, and
while doing so Harry came forward, and said:
"Isn't your name Walter?"</p>

<p>The man started back and held up his hand:
"What makes you think so?" he asked in alarm.</p>

<p>"Because <i>Retlaw</i> reversed, spells Walter," answered
Harry.</p>

<p>It was time for the Professor to show surprise
at the acuteness of Harry's conclusions. John took
the cue at once. "Why are you trying to deceive
us?"</p>

<p>He dropped his eyes, and was silent, and then he
slowly turned to the quiet man.</p>

<p>John noticed the movement. "Who was the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_212" id="p_212" href="#p_212">p. 212</a></span>
tied to the vessel and wrecked on the island to the
south of us?"</p>

<p>This question by John produced an added agitation
in the deportment of the man. He was visibly
affected by the question, but there was no reply.</p>

<p>"As you do not feel disposed to answer our questions
we must detain or keep you in custody until
Clifford recovers," said John, and motioning to the
boys, they gathered around him, and called in the
attendants and ordered the men to take charge of
him.</p>

<p>As they were about to pass out the door, Ephraim
ascended the steps and was about to pass into the
open door. He caught sight of the curious group,
and when his eye alighted on the figure on the couch,
he drew back for a moment, while his gaze remained
fixed.</p>

<p>Then he calmly moved forward, slowly shaking
his head from side to side, and muttered: "That
looks like Clifford, my companion on the ship, and
the one who aided me to gain a foothold on the spar.
How did he come here?"</p>

<p>"That is the man we found at Hutoton," said
John. "But do you know this man?" he asked,
pointing to Walter.</p>

<p>Ephraim turned, and scrutinized his face. "No, I
have never seen him, to my knowledge."</p>

<p>Walter moved back with a sigh of relief, while
John and the Professor looked at each other with
puzzled expressions.</p>

<p>"Then the man we found tied to the boat was not
Clifford!" exclaimed George.</p>

<p>John looked at Walter, and he saw him grow pale.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_213" id="p_213" href="#p_213">p. 213</a></span></p>

<p>"Who was the man," he asked, in a threatening tone,
as he approached Walter. The latter hesitated.
"We are determined to ferret out this matter, and
it will be to your advantage to tell us the whole
story, for we shall find it out sooner or later."</p>

<p>"I must have time to think," he answered, as he
put his hands to his head, and turned to Clifford.</p>

<p>"You may have until to-morrow, but in the meantime,
we shall see to it that you are kept within
our sight," responded John, as he motioned to the
men to take him away.</p>

<p>As he left the door Harry said: "Why do you
suppose he wanted time?"</p>

<p>John looked at Clifford for a moment, and answered:
"Evidently, he had hopes that Clifford
would not survive."</p>

<h3>UNRAVELING THE MYSTERIES</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>At</span> the suggestion of the Professor, Clifford was
left in quiet, while John and the boys deferred their
further attempts to explore the mysterious occurrences
that were looming up.</p>

<p>They canvassed every phase of the situation, in the
hope that some explanation might be offered.
What could have been the relations of Walter and
Clifford, and who was the man that met his death
in the boat at Venture Island?</p>

<p>Why had the sight of the copper box and the skulls
so agitated Walter? The latter, apparently, knew
of the missive, which was, evidently, written by him,
but why did he not give an outright answer concerning
it when John asked him point blank?</p>

<p>It did not take the boys long to inform Sutoto of
the development and the mystery concerning the
two men. The old Chief, Beralsea, was taken over
to see Walter, in order to identify him if possible,
and then Harry suggested that Ta Babeda might
know something of his early history, as Walter was
found a prisoner at his village when John and the
boys arrived there.</p>

<p>Beralsea had never seen nor heard of him, and
Ta Babeda gave the following account of his capture:
"About three years previously several men,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_215" id="p_215" href="#p_215">p. 215</a></span>
of whom Walter was one, arrived at the island, on a
small boat, something like the one carried by the
<i>Pioneer</i>, and which was used at the landing."</p>

<p>(It should be stated that one of the boats, and
probably, the one referred to, was the identical lifeboat,
No. 3, which the boys had fitted up for use on
the <i>Pioneer</i>.)</p>

<p>"This boat was kept by them at the inlet directly
east of the cave where the Korinos were lodged. I
did not know anything of this for some time, but the
Korinos learned of the presence of the men, and my
warriors were set to watch the men. A few days
afterwards, another boat, much smaller, appeared
with two men, but from all appearances they were a
different party, and after they had a conference, it
appeared as though there was trouble between the
different parties."</p>

<p>"We were about to close in on them, when at the
height of their quarrel, but they caught sight of us,
and joined in resisting the attack against us. With
the guns they had we were no match for them, so we
had to retire to the village.</p>

<p>"The next morning we learned that they had gone,
and on searching the shore found something with
marks on, it, that had no meaning to us so it was destroyed."</p>

<p>"Was it something like this?" asked Harry, handing
him a sketch.</p>

<p>The Chief studied it for a few moments, and answered:
"It seems to me it was like that. The
marks were something like these," and he pointed to
the crosses.</p>

<p>Harry had made the identical marking which were<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_216" id="p_216" href="#p_216">p. 216</a></span>
on the two skulls, which, it will be remembered,
showed the characters + V, and below these three
X X X, followed by a star.</p>

<p>"I suspected as much," said John. "They were,
quite possibly, on the same quest. But where did
they get the information?" And he turned to the
Professor for a possible explanation.</p>

<p>The latter was now thoroughly interested. "Unless
Walter chooses to tell, the matter may not be
solved, unless Clifford recovers, and even though
he should regain his physical powers, the mind may
have relapsed into its late condition."</p>

<p>By agreement John and the boys remained at the
Professor's home that night, awaiting symptoms of
the patient's disease, and during the night they recounted
over and over again the adventures they
had undergone, and the experiences with the natives.</p>

<p>They conversed about the new enterprise into
which they were to embark, and the Professor congratulated
them on the decision to remain and enter
the commercial, or business field. "After all," he
said, "there is nothing which so broadens a man as
to have an occupation, and give to that business the
energies of his mind."</p>

<p>"Of course, there are many things that the natives
must learn, but they are so willing to work,
that it is a pleasure to show them," said Harry.
"The best men we have had in the shops were the
common natives, but there is one thing that has always
been troublesome, and that is to give them
different names."</p>

<p>"That is just what I had in mind for some time,"
added George. "It didn't make much difference<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_217" id="p_217" href="#p_217">p. 217</a></span>
where there were only a few,&mdash;a hundred or so, but
now, when we have three hundred or more it is rather
confusing to have a dozen or more <i>Lolos</i>, and as
many more <i>Walbes</i>, and names like that."</p>

<p>"It might be a good idea to suggest that each
one have a sort of surname, so that there will be no
difficulty of that kind hereafter," suggested John.</p>

<p>"A family name would be the proper thing,"
added the Professor.</p>

<p>"For my part, I don't see how people can get
along without it," remarked George.</p>

<p>"But it has not always been the custom to have
surnames, or family names," suggested the Professor.</p>

<p>"But the Romans did," exclaimed George.</p>

<p>"Yes, they had three names: the first was the prenomen,
which was a distinctive mark of the individual;
then the nomen, or the name of the clan; and
third, the cognomen, which was the family name.
The first name was usually written with a capital
letter only, like M. Thus, M. Tullius Cicero."</p>

<p>"Well, that is the first time it ever occurred to
me that the Romans parted their names in the middle,"
said George, as he smiled at the allusion.</p>

<p>"The ancient Greeks, with the exception of a few
of the leading families in Athens and Sparta, had
only a single name. Among the German and Celtic
nations each individual had only one name, and that
was also true of the ancient Hebrews; the names
Abraham, David, Aaron and the others were used
singly, and this was also the case in Egypt,
Syria and Persia, and throughout all of Western
Asia."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_218" id="p_218" href="#p_218">p. 218</a></span></p>

<p>"But it has never been so in England, has it?"
asked Harry.</p>

<p>"During the entire period that England was under
the dominion of the Saxons, the single name was
prevalent. But that was changed later when feudalism
was established and the different lords began
to gather their vassals, and to register them."</p>

<p>"But what is the principle on which the names are
built?"</p>

<p>"In various ways; at first they distinguished
father and son by adding the word <i>son</i> to the
father's name. If he was of German descent <i>sohn</i>
would be added; if of Danish origin, the word <i>sen</i>,
so that the son's name in either case would be William<i>son</i>,
or Ander<i>sohn</i>, or Thorwald<i>sen</i>, or a given
name with the designation <i>son</i> added."</p>

<p>"But how about the many other names, and those
coming after the second generation?"</p>

<p>"They had to be named after the locality, like
John <i>Brook</i>, or David <i>Hill</i>, or something of that
kind, even to an occupation, like the <i>Smiths</i>, or the
<i>Fishers</i>, as well as qualifications, such as <i>Wise</i> and
<i>Good</i> were adopted as surnames."</p>

<p>Every hour Clifford's condition was noted, and
before morning his pulse began to beat with greater
regularity, and all felt that it would be well to take
a nap, to prepare for what they knew must be an
interesting, if not exciting chapter, to round out
their adventures, and to lay bare the few mysteries
which yet remained to be solved.</p>

<p>Sutoto came to the Professor's house quite early,
with news from Blakely that Walter had disappeared.
He had learned of the imprisonment and<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_219" id="p_219" href="#p_219">p. 219</a></span>
that Walter was placed in the regular lock-up, where
a few recalcitrants were confined.</p>

<p>How he escaped was not known. True, not much
of a guard was maintained, and the natives had no
idea that the prisoner was of more than ordinary importance.</p>

<p>John was very much disappointed, but he felt that
he alone was to blame, because in the anxiety for
Clifford he had entirely overlooked the precaution
necessary. He went down to the jail, with the boys,
and learned from the inmates that when the man
was brought in he appeared to be unconcerned, and
immediately selected his sleeping quarters, and that
was the last they knew of him.</p>

<p>As the boys were going to their own rooms, a messenger
came from the Professor that Clifford was
awake, and appeared to be rational, and was now
partaking of food. After breakfast they hurried
over to the Professor, and found John there smiling.</p>

<p>"I have had a little talk with him."</p>

<p>"What does he say?"</p>

<p>"I have not yet questioned him."</p>

<p>Clifford looked at the boys curiously. "Are you
the boys that Mr. Varney spoke about?"</p>

<p>"I suppose we are," said Harry.</p>

<p>"His story interested me very much. I learn that
you have a regular manufacturing town here, and
that you built all these things without any outside
help, before you communicated with the outside
world."</p>

<p>"Yes; and we had a glorious time doing it, too,
but we owe everything to the Professor and John."</p>

<p>"That is really commendable to hear you say so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_220" id="p_220" href="#p_220">p. 220</a></span>
But you said, Mr. Varney, that Walter told you Clifford
limped, and it was on account of this peculiarity
you were led to believe that the dead man on
Venture Island was Clifford?"</p>

<p>"One of the three men with Walter, was lame."</p>

<p>"Then it must have been one of his party that was
murdered?"</p>

<p>"But Walter was explicit to tell us that one of
your legs was shorter than the other. I early
learned that such was not the case, and that is what
confused me in identifying you. But there is also
another thing which I could not understand."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Ephraim Wilmar."</p>

<p>"Stop! stop!" almost shouted Clifford. "You
said <i>Ephraim Wilmar</i>. Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Know him? He is here on the island."</p>

<p>"When did he come? Where is he?"</p>

<p>"He lives on an island north of the place we
found you, and is Chief of a tribe there."</p>

<p>"Chief of a tribe!" he exclaimed. "An island to
the north,&mdash;the <i>triangle</i>,"&mdash;and the boys rose from
their seats in the excitement.</p>

<p>"Where is Walter's letter?&mdash;Quick," said Harry.</p>

<p>George fumbled in his pockets with eagerness.
"Is that the triangle?" eagerly questioned Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; there it is again. The three islands,
and the arrow."</p>

<p>"But what does the star mean,&mdash;the star that follows,
as you see?"</p>

<p>"That,&mdash;that is to show the position of the three
islands."</p>

<p>"Position of the three islands? What islands?<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_221" id="p_221" href="#p_221">p. 221</a></span>
and how does it tell the positions?" George was
fairly frantic now.</p>

<p>"There must be three islands, and one of them
was the one I was on when you found me, and one is
here, because Mr. Varney told me about this one,
and then there is another, which you said was to
the north of,&mdash;of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hutoton," said John.</p>

<p>"Yes; Hutoton. But the positions! Yes; you
will understand! One point is the Southern Cross,
near the South polar Circle, the second point is the
fixed star Antares, and the third is the fixed star
Spica, which, together form a perfect triangle, one
limb of which passes through a cluster of stars
called the Compasses."</p>

<p>"But what has that to do with the locations of the
three islands?"</p>

<p>"They are situated, with relation to each other,
exactly the same as the three stars are placed in the
heavens."</p>

<p>"What was the object of the three crosses before
the star?"</p>

<p>"The three represented thirty."</p>

<p>"Thirty what?"</p>

<p>"Leagues."</p>

<p>"And the arrow?"</p>

<p>"The direction from Spica."</p>

<p>"Why from Spica?"</p>

<p>"Because that star is the one which represents the
island on which this particular chart happens to be
found."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that a similar chart will be found
on each island?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_222" id="p_222" href="#p_222">p. 222</a></span></p>

<p>"No; on only two of them."</p>

<p>The boys were astounded at this information.
John and the Professor remained quiet while the
boys thus questioned Clifford.</p>

<p>John interrupted to inquire why there were only
two charts.</p>

<p>"The record is found on the third."</p>

<p>"So Wonder and Venture Islands are the only
ones which have the inscriptions on the skulls?"
asked Harry.</p>

<p>Clifford sat up with such a sudden start that the
boys were alarmed. He leaned forward, and hurriedly
asked the following questions: "You say,
'Inscriptions on the skulls?' How do you know?
and why do you say that they are on Wonder and
Venture Islands?"</p>

<p>"Because we have two of them."</p>

<p>He dropped back on the pillow, and reflected for
some time, and then slowly said: "But there must
be three. One of them is still with the records."</p>

<p>"No; we have the one with the records."</p>

<p>A smile illuminated his features, the tension was
relaxed, and he dropped back, and pressed his hands
over his forehead, as he muttered: "I am so glad,
so glad, so glad," and his voice died down, and he
remained quiet, as though in sleep.</p>

<p>The questioners sat there in silence, and watched
him as he slept. The Professor motioned them to
withdraw, and they passed into the adjoining room.</p>

<p>"It is clear to me now," remarked John. "The
knowledge of the record was known to others, and
I was not aware that any one besides ourselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_223" id="p_223" href="#p_223">p. 223</a></span>
really had figured out the secret," remarked John,
as he turned to the Professor.</p>

<p>"Well, I came pretty close to it," exclaimed
Harry. "I told you that the three X's meant thirty
leagues."</p>

<p>"So you did," said John. "Prior to the finding
of the skull I did not know of the full inscription.
Its significance did not come to me until we reached
Venture Island."</p>

<p>"I remember now! I told George that I saw the
chart you had made."</p>

<p>John smiled. "It would have deceived you, however."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Because, if you remember it the third island was
to the south of Venture, and not to the north as we
really found it."</p>

<h3>THE STORY OF THE LETTERED SKULL</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>It</span> was late that afternoon when Clifford awoke,
and plainly much, refreshed, and improved physically.
When he saw the Professor he said: "I
have not told you all, but I want the boys here for
that purpose, because I know it will interest them."</p>

<p>When the boys arrived they awaited the coming of
John, who informed them that Uraso had received
word of the capture of Walter, but that he would not
arrive until noon.</p>

<p>Clifford greeted them effusively, and it was evident
that he had recovered his spirits, and was well
on the road to recovery. After some general talk
on uninteresting topics, he began his story:</p>

<p>"I was on the vessel with Ephraim when we ran
into the monsoon which wrecked the vessel. After
days of suffering I became unconscious, and when
the spar finally reached the shore, I was aroused
sufficiently to save myself, and after wandering
around for some time, came up to a tribe of natives,
who took good care of me.</p>

<p>"I had no means of determining the latitude or
longitude, because I was then only about twenty
years of age, and had shipped on the vessel at
Shanghai, because I was anxious to return home. I
remained with the people about three years, and
they were called Osagas."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_225" id="p_225" href="#p_225">p. 225</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, this town is built in the Osagas' territory,"
said Harry.</p>

<p>"That may be so, but it is enough for the present
to know that it was somewhere on this island that I
reached the shore, and that about three years thereafter
I was fortunate enough to catch sight of a sailing
vessel, and on her I reached San Francisco.</p>

<p>"In course of time I built up a profitable shipping
business, and owned several vessels engaged in the
coast and Alaska trade. Like all shipping men on
the western coast, I learned of the many accounts,
most of them fables, concerning the treasures on the
islands in the South Seas, but they never had any
effect on me until about three years ago, I had a
hand in furnishing the outfit for a vessel which departed
on such a mission, that sailed some time in
December or January, of that year."</p>

<p>"Do you know the name of the vessel?" asked
John.</p>

<p>"Yes; the <i>Juan Ferde</i>. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"I sailed in that vessel with Blakely, one of the
owners."</p>

<p>"Blakely? Blakely, did you say? Why he is the
man who purchased all the provisions from me."</p>

<p>"He is here on the island, and now has charge of
all the business matters connected with our venture."</p>

<p>"Well, that is remarkable, indeed; but I must proceed.
Four months after the <i>Juan Ferde</i> sailed, I
came into contact with a peculiar character, who had
been all over the southern part of the universe, and
he finally interested me sufficiently to look over some
peculiar documents which he had, bearing on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_226" id="p_226" href="#p_226">p. 226</a></span>
subject of the lost treasures, and from the information
which he gave, it occurred to me that the location
could not be far from the island where I was
cast ashore.</p>

<p>"With a good business, and entirely free from all
family entanglements, I made up my mind that I
would accompany him, and finance the undertaking.
What induced me more than anything else, was the
fact that the stories he told corresponded so nearly
with the information which Blakely gave me, although
the latter did not go into many details, that
I looked on the venture in the nature of a lark. Besides
I wanted to meet my old friends on the island,
and possibly induce them to gather the products
of the island for me.</p>

<p>"We sailed about five months after the <i>Juan
Ferde</i> left, and had a quick run to the island where
it was supposed I had been left years before. It
seems that at the time I landed there the tribe was
at war, and we had a terrible time to get away from
the people, who, of course, did not remember me,
even though the tribe was the same, but of this I had
no absolute knowledge at the time.</p>

<p>"Two months after reaching the island, we sailed
to the south, in order to explore the second island,
noted on the chart, and it was then that the returning
monsoon, which usually blows in the opposite
direction from the one of six months before, wrecked
the vessel, and the next day one of my companions
and myself, who were so far as I then knew, the only
survivors, reached the southern shore of an island,
where we saw high mountains, so unlike those in the
island where I was shipwrecked years before."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_227" id="p_227" href="#p_227">p. 227</a></span></p>

<p>"While I think of it," remarked John, "how did
you know about the second island, to which you refer?"</p>

<p>"I learned this from Walter."</p>

<p>"Then did you know anything about the skull on
the headland, and the note which Walter left?"</p>

<p>"I knew about the skull, but never heard of the
note to which you refer. The discovery of the skull
was an accident, and I attached no importance to it
at the time. From the southern portion of the island
we journeyed along the eastern coast, to the
north, skirting a large forest on the way."</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other, significantly, but
he did not notice this.</p>

<p>"Then we reached a large river, and to our surprise,
found a boat, evidently of native manufacture,
and with this floated down the stream to the sea."</p>

<p>"But where did you get the rope that we found in
the boat?" asked George, eagerly.</p>

<p>He turned, and answered: "How did you know
we put any rope on the boat?"</p>

<p>"Because that was the boat we made, and we
found it afterwards, with the strange rope and
oars."</p>

<p>"Strange oars. I know nothing about them. We
used the oars found in the boat."</p>

<p>"Did you get the boat near a large falls?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And on the north side of the river?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but after we reached the sea, it was too
rough, and the wind was blowing too heavily from
the north to make it safe to navigate in that direction,
so we went south, probably ten miles, and drew<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_228" id="p_228" href="#p_228">p. 228</a></span>
ashore. The next morning when I awoke the boat
and my companion were missing."</p>

<p>"Who was your companion?"</p>

<p>"Walter."</p>

<p>John looked indignant, and expressed his opinion
very forcibly, but Clifford held up his hand, restrainingly.
"Do not be too harsh. I have no ill will
toward him. I did not know what to do, nor which
way to turn, but went to the west, and before night,
came, unexpectedly, on the remains of a fire, which
led me to believe that I would find friends in the inhabitants.</p>

<p>"I went on and on, and caught up with the band,
and was then horrified to find that they were having
a feast, and sacrificing human beings. I saw Walter
among the captives, but I could not contrive to let
him know of my presence, and left the place as hurriedly
as I could.</p>

<p>"After a month of struggling I reached the southern
part of the island, and there, to my joy, found
three of my companions on a life boat, belonging to
a vessel called the <i>Investigator</i>, and together we
made a course southeast, and there found the location
of the second skull."</p>

<p>"But you knew nothing of that at the time, did
you?"</p>

<p>"I did not know what the marks on the skull were
for, but the finding of the second one was sufficient
to revive in me the hope that, after all, the treasure
might be found. One of the men, who was the intimate
of Walter, figured out the course to be taken,
and we reached the island to the north the second
day.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_229" id="p_229" href="#p_229">p. 229</a></span></p>

<p>"There, to our surprise, we found Walter, and he
charged one of the men with me, with trying to secure
the treasure, but I finally patched up the matter,
and we agreed to work in concert. Then, when
the next day, we found that Walter had lost the
chart, we felt that it was a trick on his part to deceive
us, and we separated. At that time I did not
believe he told us the truth.</p>

<p>"Two days afterwards we passed a party of natives,
who were not aware of our presence, and then
we saw that Walter, and the man with him, had been
captured, and later believed that they had been
killed. We searched the island, to find the cave, but
were unsuccessful and thinking that an error might
have been made, we concluded to sail for the island
to the south.</p>

<p>"We found a tribe of natives when we landed, and
owing to the exposure and the trials we had gone
through I was taken ill, and grew worse and worse,
and from that time on to the time I recovered two
days ago, I had not the slightest idea of what
passed."</p>

<p>"When I spoke against Walter a few moments
ago," said John, "you said he was not to blame.
What did you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"During my wanderings, I found parts of the
chart, which, I assumed, had been lost by John, and,
probably, destroyed by the natives. The part I recovered
was of no value to me, but it entirely
changed my opinion of Walter."</p>

<p>But Clifford's story left something to be told. It
did not explain why Walter tried to avoid meeting
Clifford; or why he was so startled upon seeing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_230" id="p_230" href="#p_230">p. 230</a></span>
two skulls, or the reason for avoiding the reference
to the letter to which his name was signed.</p>

<p>The boys were so intensely interested in his story
that they did not notice the entrance of Blakely, who
had brought Walter back, but when Clifford saw
Blakely there was immediate recognition.</p>

<p>Clifford held out his hand to Walter, as he said:
"I did wrong in doubting you. I understand from
the statement made by Ta Babeda, that they found
the chart the next day, after we met them, and that,
of course, clears you."</p>

<p>"But I would like to know," said Harry, "what
the other part of the inscription on the skulls
means?"</p>

<p>"Do you refer to the sign of plus and the V?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"When you went into the cave, where you found
the copper box, how many chambers did you pass
before coming to the large room?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure," he answered, "but I think four."</p>

<p>"Yes; and the case was found in the fifth chamber.
The Plus sign indicated the cross-shaped cave,
did it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and there are several other things which
interest me," remarked George, gazing at John, as
he continued: "Why should the inscriptions have
been marked on the skulls?"</p>

<p>John slowly shook his head, as he looked at Clifford.
The latter gazed vacantly into space, as
though reflecting, and finally said: "I do not
know."</p>

<p>It will be remembered that when Walter entered
the Professor's room, where Clifford was lying, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_231" id="p_231" href="#p_231">p. 231</a></span>
appeared to be startled at the sight of the skulls.
The copper box which held one of them was in the
adjoining room.</p>

<p>During the foregoing conversation Walter was
mute, nor did he appear interested in the question
propounded by George.</p>

<p>"It seems most curious to me that the skull taken
from the copper box has the inscription on the right
side, whereas the other one has them on the left
side," observed Harry.</p>

<p>John and George saw the immediate change in
Walter's face while Harry was speaking. His agitation
was now plain to all, and the perspiration began
to appear on his forehead.</p>

<p>John leaned forward as he said: "Do you
know?"</p>

<p>Walter started at the vehemence of the question,
and threw back his head, as he answered: "Did
you find the copper box?"</p>

<p>"Yes," responded John, with a look of triumph.</p>

<p>Walter's features relaxed, and he seemed to sink
down, as he gazed about him with a final look of despair.</p>

<p>"Then the quest is ended!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Explain!" demanded
John.</p>

<p>"When I began the search for the treasure of the
caves, I was the owner of the original document written
by Juan Guiterez before he died in the Spanish
prison. Three attempts had been made to find the
island, which contained the secret, and that secret
was in the copper box which told of the places and
the locations of the other caves. In each case the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_232" id="p_232" href="#p_232">p. 232</a></span>
quest failed, and all perished. The peculiar significance
arises from the fact that the only directions
were given on a human skull by Guiterez himself,
who declared that two of the skulls would have the
inscriptions on the left side, while the one with the
cryptic signs on the right side would be accompanied
by the descriptions of the locations of all the Caves
on the different islands."</p>

<p>"But why should there be three skulls?" asked
George, in great eagerness.</p>

<p>"There were three attempts, each resulting in
death. The skull is emblematic of death."</p>

<p>"Will you tell us why you tried to avoid Clifford,
and were startled at the sight of the skulls?" asked
John.</p>

<p>"If, as you say, you have found the copper box, I
have no further reason to remain silent. I found
one of the skulls,&mdash;the others I could not find, one
of which I knew must be in the treasure cave. If I
had known you found the one in the cave I should
not have tried to get away, as I hoped, finally, to
find the cave. Since coming here I learned that you
had found the third island; I knew of only two, and
supposed that the two skulls were from those two,
namely, Wonder and Venture Islands."</p>

<p>"But who placed the skulls there?" queried
Harry.</p>

<p>"Ah! No one knows that. The Spaniard Guiterez
offers no explanation. All the so-called
<i>treasure charts</i> have been made from the accounts
which he gave, of the vast amount of gold and silver
which is hidden in these natural caches. The place
where the copper box was deposited is the grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_233" id="p_233" href="#p_233">p. 233</a></span>
mausoleum. Only those who know the secret could
ever reach the vault. All others would perish."</p>

<p>"The carbonic gas!" exclaimed George.</p>

<p>Walter turned to George, as he said this, but did
not comprehend what he meant. It was now evident
that Walter had tried to conceal his identity, and
thereby hide the secret which would enable him
alone to find the vast wealth.</p>

<p>"So the letter which we found concealed in the
seat of our boat, was written by one of your companions?"
asked Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"This clears up the mysterious things which we
have tried to fathom for over two years," said John.
"The meaning of the letters is now clear."</p>

<p>"From the time we landed on the island," rejoined
the Professor, "we found evidences of white
people that we could not follow up, and it is now
plain that they were in search for the treasure, so
we can now comprehend what the notes meant."</p>

<p>There is but little more to add to the chapter pertaining
to the experiences of the boys on the islands.
Perhaps, at some time in the future, their work on
the new islands will be told. What John and the
boys found in the Copper box, the historical sketches
and the locations of the treasure islands which were
pointed out on the parchments found in the compartment
below the skull, were amazing revelations of
the days of piratical adventures, when the southern
half of the world was one vast carnival of crime, in
which gold was the only booty and to obtain which
the means were always considered to be justified
by the end.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_234" id="p_234" href="#p_234">p. 234</a></span></p>

<p>Our young friends, during their experiences in
southern waters, did their part in bringing to the uneducated
savages the blessings of civilization and
the great boon of peace. To themselves they
brought a store of hard-earned knowledge and a
memory of things well done that will last them to
the end of their days.</p>

<h2>THE BOY GLOBE TROTTERS</h2>

<p class="titleblock" style="font-size: 115%">By ELBERT FISHER</p>
<p class="titleblock"><i>12mo, Cloth.     Many Illustrations.     60c. per Volume</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em">This is a series of four books relating the adventures of two boys, who
make a trip around the world, working their way as they go. They
meet with various peoples having strange habits and customs, and their
adventures form a medium for the introduction of much instructive
matter relative to the character and industries of the cities and countries
through which they pass. A description is given of the native sports
of boys in each of the foreign countries through which they travel. The
books are illustrated by decorative head and end pieces for each chapter,
there being 36 original drawings in each book, all by the author, and four
striking halftones.</p>

<p><b>1. From New York to the Golden Gate</b>, takes in many of the principal
points between New York and California, and contains a highly
entertaining narrative of the boys' experiences overland and not a little
useful information.</p>

<p><b>2. From San Francisco to Japan</b>, relates the experiences of the two
boys at the Panama Exposition, and subsequently their journeyings to
Hawaii, Samoa and Japan. The greater portion of their time is spent
at sea, and a large amount of interesting information appears throughout
the text.</p>

<p><b>3. From Tokio to Bombay</b>. This book covers their interesting
experiences in Japan, followed by sea voyages to the Philippines, Hong-kong
and finally to India. Their experiences with the natives cover a
field seldom touched upon in juvenile publications, as it relates to the
great Hyderabad region of South India.</p>

<p><b>4. From India to the War Zone</b>, describes their trip toward the
Persian Gulf. They go by way of the River Euphrates and pass the
supposed site of the Garden of Eden, and manage to connect themselves
with a caravan through the Great Syrian Desert. After traversing
the Holy Land, where they visit the Dead Sea, they arrive at the Mediterranean
port of Joppa, and their experiences thereafter within the war
zone are fully described.</p>

and the rudiments of architecture. It contains over two
hundred and fifty illustrations made especially for this work, and
includes also a complete glossary of the technical terms used in the
art. The most comprehensive volume on this subject ever published
for boys.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Electricity for Boys</span></h3>

<p>The author has adopted the unique plan of setting forth the fundamental
principles in each phase of the science, and practically
applying the work in the successive stages. It shows how the
knowledge has been developed, and the reasons for the various
phenomena, without using technical words so as to bring it within
the compass of every boy. It has a complete glossary of terms, and
is illustrated with two hundred original drawings.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Practical Mechanics for Boys</span></h3>

<p>This book takes the beginner through a comprehensive series of
practical shop work, in which the uses of tools, and the structure
and handling of shop machinery are set forth; how they are utilized
to perform the work, and the manner in which all dimensional work
is carried out. Every subject is illustrated, and model building
explained. It contains a glossary which comprises a new system of
cross references, a feature that will prove a welcome departure in
explaining subjects. Fully illustrated.</p>

<h3>A SERIES OF BOOKS FOR BOYS</h3>
<h4>By Capt. Alan Douglas, Scout-master</h4>

<p style="text-indent: 0;"><b>The Campfires of the Wolf Patrol</b></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; font-size: 85%;">
Their first camping experience affords the scouts splendid opportunities to use
their recently acquired knowledge in a practical way. Elmer Chenoweth, a lad
from the northwest woods, astonishes everyone by his familiarity with camp
life. A clean, wholesome story every boy should read.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0;"><b>Woodcraft; or, How a Patrol Leader Made Good</b></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; font-size: 85%;">
This tale presents many stirring situations in which some of the boys are called
upon to exercise all their ingenuity and unselfishness. A story filled with
healthful excitement.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0;"><b>Pathfinder; or, The Missing Tenderfoot</b></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; font-size: 85%;">
Some mysteries are cleared up in a most unexpected way, greatly to the credit
of our young friends. A variety of incidents follow fast, one after the other.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0;"><b>Fast Nine; or, a Challenge From Fairfield</b></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; font-size: 85%;">
They show the same team-work here as when in camp. The description of the
final game with the team of a rival town, and the outcome thereof, form a
stirring narrative. One of the best baseball stories of recent years.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0;"><b>Great Hike; or, The Pride of The Khaki Troop</b></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; font-size: 85%;">
After weeks of preparation the scouts start out on their greatest undertaking.
Their march takes them far from home, and the good-natured rivalry of the
different patrols furnishes many interesting and amusing situations.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0;"><b>Endurance Test; or, How Clear Grit Won the Day</b></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; font-size: 85%;">
Few stories "get" us more than illustrations of pluck in the face of apparent
failure. Our heroes show the stuff they are made of and surprise their most
ardent admirers. One of the best stories Captain Douglas has written.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0;"><b>Under Canvas; or, The Hunt for the Cartaret Ghost</b></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; font-size: 85%;">
It was hard to disbelieve the evidence of their eyes but the boys by the
exercise of common-sense solved a mystery which had long puzzled older heads.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0;"><b>Storm-bound; or, a Vacation Among the Snow Drifts</b></p>

<p style="text-indent: 0; font-size: 85%;">
The boys start out on the wrong track, but their scout training comes to the
rescue and their experience proves beneficial to all concerned.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 0;"><b>Boy Scout Nature Lore to be Found in The Hickory Ridge Boy
Scout Series, all illustrated:&mdash;</b></p>
